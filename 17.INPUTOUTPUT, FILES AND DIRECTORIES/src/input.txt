On January 1, 1533, Michael Angelo, then fifty-seven years old, writes
from Florence to Tommaso de' Cavalieri, a youth of noble Roman family,
who afterwards became his favourite pupil: "If I do not possess the
art of navigating the sea of your potent genius, that genius will
nevertheless excuse me, and neither despise my inequality, nor demand
of me that which I have it not in me to give; since that which stands
alone in everything can in nothing find its counterpart. Wherefore your
lordship, _the only light in our age vouchsafed to this worlds_ having
no equal or peer, cannot find satisfaction in the work of any other
hand. If, therefore, this or that in the works which I hope and promise
to execute should happen to please you, I should call that work, not
good, but fortunate. And if I should ever feel assured that--as has
been reported to me--I have given your lordship satisfaction in one
thing or another, I will make a gift to you of my present and of all
that the future may bring me; and it will be a great pain to me to be
unable to recall the past, in order to serve you so much the longer,
instead of having only the future, which cannot be long, since I am all
too old. There is nothing more left for me to say. Read my heart and
not my letter, for my pen cannot approach the expression of my good
will."[3]

Cavalieri writes to Michael Angelo that he regards himself as born
anew since he has come to know the Master; who replies, "I for my part
should regard myself as not born, born dead, or deserted by heaven and
earth, if your letters had not brought me the persuasion that your
lordship accepts with favour certain of my works." And in a letter of
the following summer to Sebastian del Piombo, he sends a greeting to
Messer Tommaso, with the words: "I believe _I should instantly fall
down dead_ if he were no longer in my thoughts."[4]

Michael Angelo plays upon his friend's surname as Shakespeare plays
upon his friend's Christian name. These are the last lines of the
thirty-first sonnet:--

   "Se vint' e pres' i' debb' esser beato,
    Meraviglia non � se, nud' e solo,
    Resto prigion d'un _Cavalier_ armato."

    "If only chains and bands can make me blest,
     No marvel if alone and bare I go
     An armed knight's captive and slave confessed."
    (_J. A. Symonds_.)

In other sonnets the tone is no less passionate than Shakespeare's
--take, for example, the twenty-second:--

    "More tenderly perchance than is my due,
     Your spirit sees into my heart, where rise
     The flames of holy worship, nor denies
     The grace reserved for those who humbly sue.
     Oh blessed day when you at last are mine!
     Let time stand still, and let noon's chariot stay;
     Fixed be that moment on the dial of heaven!
     That I may clasp and keep, by grace divine--
     Clasp in these yearning arms and keep for aye
     My heart's loved lord to me desertless given."[5]
                                    (_J. A. Symonds_.)

In comparison with Cavalieri, Michael Angelo could with justice call
himself old. Some critics, on the other hand, have seen in the fact
that Shakespeare was not really old at the time when the Sonnets were
written, a proof of their conventional and unreal character. But this
is to overlook the relativity of the term. As compared with a youth of
eighteen, Shakespeare was in effect old, with his sixteen additional
years and all his experience of life. And if we are right in assigning
Sonnets lxiii. and lxxiii. to the year 1600 or 1601, Shakespeare had
then reached the age of thirty-seven, an age at which (among his
contemporaries) Drayton in his _Idea_ dwells quite in the same spirit
upon the wrinkles of age in his face, and at which, as Tyler has very
aptly pointed out, Byron in his swan-song uses expressions about
himself which might have been copied from Shakespeare's seventy-third
Sonnet. Shakespeare says:--

    "That time of year thou mayst in me behold
     When _yellow leaves_, or none, or few, do hang
     Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
     Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."

Byron thus expresses himself:--

    "My days are in _the yellow leaf_,[6]
       The flowers and fruits of love are gone,
     The worm, the canker and the grief
       Are mine alone."

In Shakespeare we read:--

    "In me thou seest _the glowing of such fire_
     That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
     As the _death-bed_ whereon it must expire,
     Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by."

Byron's words are:--

    "_The fire that on my bosom preys_
          Is lone as some volcanic isle;
     No torch is kindled at its blaze--
       _A funeral pile_"

Thus both poets liken themselves, at this comparatively early age, to
the wintry woods with their yellowing leaves, and without blossom,
fruit, or the song of birds; and both compare the fire which still
glows in their soul to a solitary flame which finds no nourishment from
without. The ashes of my youth become its death-bed, says Shakespeare.
They are a funeral pile, says Byron.

Nor is it possible to conclude, as Sch�ck does, from the conventional
style of the first seventeen Sonnets--for instance, from their almost
verbal identity with a passage in Sidney's _Arcadia_--that they are
quite devoid of relation to the poet's own life.

In short, the elements of temporary fashion and convention which appear
in the Sonnets in no way prove that they were not genuine expressions
of the poet's actual feelings.

They lay bare to us a side of his character which does not appear in
the plays. We see in him an emotional nature with a passionate bent
towards self-surrender in love and idolatry, and with a corresponding,
though less excessive, yearning to be loved.

We learn from the Sonnets to what a degree Shakespeare was oppressed
and tormented by his sense of the contempt in which the actor's calling
was held. The scorn of ancient Rome for the mountebank, the horror of
ancient Judea for whoever disguised himself in the garments of the
other sex, and finally the age-old hatred of Christianity for theatres
and all the temptations that follow in their train--all these habits
of thought had been handed down from generation to generation, and, as
Puritanism grew in strength and gained the upper hand, had begotten a
contemptuous tone of public opinion under which so sensitive a nature
as Shakespeare's could not but suffer keenly. He was not regarded as
a poet who now and then acted, but as an actor who now and then wrote
plays. It was a pain to him to feel that he belonged to a caste which
had no civic status. Hence his complaint, in Sonnet xxix., of being "in
disgrace with fortune and men's eyes." Hence, in Sonnet xxxvi., his
assurance to his friend that he will not obtrude on others the fact of
their friendship:--

    "I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
     Lest my bewail�d guilt should do thee shame:
     Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
     Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
     But do not so; I love thee in such sort,
     As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report."

The bitter complaint in Sonnet lxxii. seems rather to refer to the
writer's situation as a dramatist:--


    "For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
     And so should you, to love things nothing worth."

The melancholy which fills Sonnet cx. is occasioned by the writer's
profession and his nature as a poet and artist:--

    "Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
     And made myself a motley to the view;
     Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
     Made old offences of affections new:
     Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth
     Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
     These blenches gave my heart another youth,
     And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love."

Hence, finally, his reproach to Fortune, in Sonnet cxi., that she did
not "better for his life provide Than public means which public manners
breeds":--

    "Thence comes it that my name receives a brand;
     And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
     To what it works in, like the dyer's hand."

We must bear in mind this continual writhing under the prejudice
against his calling and his art, and this indignation at the injustice
of the attitude adopted towards them by a great part of the middle
classes, if we would understand the high pressure of Shakespeare's
feelings towards the noble youth who had approached him full of the
art-loving traditions of the aristocracy, and the burning enthusiasm
of the young for intellectual superiority. William Herbert, with his
beauty and his personal charm, must have come to him like a very angel
of light, a messenger from a higher world than that in which his lot
was cast. He was a living witness to the fact that Shakespeare was not
condemned to seek the applause of the multitude alone, but could win
the favour of the noblest in the land, and was not excluded from a deep
and almost passionate friendship which placed him on an equal footing
with the bearer of an ancient name. Pembroke's great beauty no doubt
made a deep impression upon the beauty-lover in Shakespeare's soul.
It is very probable, too, that the young aristocrat, according to the
fashion of the times, made the poet his debtor for solider benefactions
than mere friendship; and Shakespeare must thus have felt doubly
painful the situation in which he was placed by the intrigue between
his mistress and his friend.[7].

In any case, the affection with which Pembroke inspired
Shakespeare--the passionate attachment, leading even to jealousy of
other poets admired by the young nobleman--had not only a vividness,
but an erotic fervour such as we never find in our century manifested
between man and man. Note such an expression as this in Sonnet cx.:--

    "Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
     Even to thy pure and most most loving breast."

This exactly corresponds to Michael Angelo's recently-quoted desire to
"clasp in his yearning arms his heart's loved lord." Or observe such a
line as this in Sonnet lxxv.:--

    "So are you to my thoughts as food to life."

We have here an exact counterpart to the following expressions in a
letter from Michael Angelo to Cavalieri, dated July 1533: "I would far
rather forget the food on which I live, which wretchedly sustains the
body alone, than your name, which sustains both body and soul, filling
both with such happiness that I can feel neither care nor fear of death
while I have it in my memory."[8]

The passionate fervour of this friendship on the Platonic model is
accompanied in Shakespeare, as in Michael Angelo, by a submissiveness
on the part of the elder friend towards the younger, which, in these
two supreme geniuses, affects the modern reader painfully. Each had put
off every shred of pride in relation to his idolised young friend. How
strange it seems to find Shakespeare calling himself young Herbert's
"slave," and assuring him that his time, more precious than that of
any other man then living, is of no value, so that his friend may let
him wait or summon him to his side as his caprice and fancy dictate.
In Sonnet lviii. he speaks of "that God who made me first your slave."
Sonnet lvii. runs thus:--

    "Being _your slave_, what should I do but tend
     Upon the hours and times of your desire?
     I have no precious time at all to spend,
     Nor services to do, till you require.
     Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
     Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
     Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
     When you have bid your servant once adieu;
     Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
     Where you may be, or your affairs suppose;
     But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,
     Save, where you are how happy you make those."

Just as Michael Angelo spoke to Cavalieri of his works as though
they were scarcely worth his friend's notice, so does Shakespeare
sometimes speak of his verses. In Sonnet xxxii. he begs his friends to
"re-survey" them when he is dead:--

    "And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
     Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
     Exceeded by the height of happier men."

This humility becomes quite despicable when a breach is threatened
between the friends. Shakespeare then repeatedly promises so to blacken
himself that his friend shall reap, not shame, but honour, from his
faithlessness. In Sonnet lxxxviii.:--

    "With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
     Upon thy part I can set down a story
     Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,
     That thou, in losing me, shalt win much glory."

Sonnet lxxxix. is still more strongly worded:--

    "Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
     To set a form upon desir�d change,
     As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,
     I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;
     Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
     Thy sweet-belov�d name no more shall dwell,
     Lest I (too much profane) should do it wrong,
     And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
        For thee, against myself I'll vow debate,
        For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate."

We are positively surprised when, in a single passage, in Sonnet lxii.,
we come upon a forcible expression of self-love; but it does not extend
beyond the first half of the Sonnet; in the second half this self-love
is already regarded as a sin, and Shakespeare humbly effaces himself
before his friend. All the more gladly does the reader welcome the few
Sonnets (lv. and lxxxi.) in which the poet confidently predicts the
immortality of these his utterances. It is true that Shakespeare is
here greatly influenced by antiquity and by the fashion of his age;
and it is simply as records of his friend's beauty and amiability that
his verses are to be preserved through all ages to come. But no poet
without a sound and vigorous self-confidence could have written either
these lines in Sonnet lv.:--

    "Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
     Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme"--

or these others in Sonnet lxxxi.:--

    "Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
     Which eyes not yet created shall o'erread;
     And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,
     When all the breathers of this world are dead."

Yet, as we see, the first and last thought is always that of the
friend, his beauty, worth, and fame. And as he will live in the
future, so he has lived in the past. Shakespeare cannot conceive
existence without him. In Sonnets which have no direct connection with
each other (lix., cvi., cxxiii.) he returns again and again to that
strange thought of a perpetual cycle or recurrence of events, which
runs through the whole of the world's history, from the Pythagoreans
and Koh�let to Friedrich Nietzsche. In view of such high-pitched
idolatry, we can well understand that the friend's faithlessness, or,
if you will, the mistress's conquest of the friend, and the sudden
severance of the bond in 1601, must have made a deep impression upon
Shakespeare's sensitive soul. The catastrophe left its mark upon him
for many a long day.

And at the same time another and purely personal mortification was
added to his troubles. Shakespeare's name was just then involved in
a degrading scandal of one sort or another. He says so expressly in
Sonnet cxii.:--

    "Your love and pity doth the impression fill
     Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow."

He here avers that he cares very little "to know his shames or praises"
from the tongues of others, and that his friend's judgment is all in
all to him; but in Sonnet cxxi., where he goes more closely into the
matter, he confesses that some "frailty" in him has given rise to these
malignant rumours, and we see that for this frailty his "sportive
blood" was to blame. He does not deny the accusation, but asks--

    "Why should others' false adulterate eyes
     Give salutation to my sportive blood?
     Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
     Which in their wills count bad what I think good?"

The details of this scandal are unknown to us. We can only conclude
that it referred to Shakespeare's alleged relation to some woman, or
implication in some amorous adventure. In discussing this point, Tyler
has aptly cited two passages in contemporary writings, though of course
without absolutely proving that they have any bearing on the matter.
The first is the above-quoted anecdote in John Manningham's Diary for
March 13, 1601 (New Style, 1602), as to Shakespeare's forestalling
Burbadge in the graces of a citizen's wife, and announcing himself as
"William the Conqueror "--an anecdote which seems to have been widely
current at the time, and no doubt arose from more or less recent
events. The second passage occurs in _The Returne from Pernassus_,
dating from December 1601, in which (iv. 3) Burbadge and Kemp are
introduced, and these words are placed in the mouth of Kemp: "O that
_Ben Ionson_ is a pestilent fellow, he brought vp _Horace_ giuing the
Poets a pill, but our fellow _Shakespeare_ hath giuen him a purge
that made him beray his credit." The allusion is evidently to the
feud between Ben Jonson on the one hand and Marston and Dekker on the
other, which culminated in 1601 with the appearance of Ben Jonson's
_Poetaster_, in which Horace serves as the poet's mouthpiece. Dekker
and Marston retorted in the same year with _Satiromastix, or the
Untrussing of the Humorous Poet_. As Shakespeare took no direct part
in this quarrel, we can only conjecture what is meant by the above
allusion. Mr. Richard Simpson has suggested that King William Rufus, in
whose reign the action of _Satiromastix_ takes place, and who "presides
over the untrussing of the humorous poet," may be intended for William
Shakespeare. Rufus, in the play, is by no means a model of chastity,
and carries off Walter Terrill's bride very much as "William the
Conqueror" in Manningham's anecdote carries off "Richard the Third's"
mistress. Simpson thinks it probable that the spectators would have
little difficulty in recognising the William the Conqueror of the
anecdote in the William Rufus of the play, whose nickname, indeed,
might be taken as referring to Shakespeare's complexion. If we accept
this interpretation, we find in _Satiromastix_ a further proof of the
notoriety of the anecdote. Whether it be this scandal or another of the
same kind to which the Sonnets refer, Shakespeare seems to have taken
greatly to heart the besmirching of his name.

It remains that we should glance at the form of the Sonnets and say a
word as to their poetic value.

As regards the form, the first and most obvious remark is that, in
spite of their name, these poems are not in reality sonnets at all, and
have, indeed, nothing in common with the sonnet except their fourteen
lines. In the structure of his so-called Sonnets Shakespeare simply
followed the tradition and convention of his country.

Sir Thomas Wyatt, the leading figure in the earlier English school of
lyrists, travelled in Italy in the year 1527, familiarised himself with
the forms and style of Italian poetry, and introduced the sonnet into
English literature. A somewhat younger poet, Henry, Earl of Surrey,
soon followed in his footsteps; he, too, travelled in Italy, and
cultivated the same poetic models. Not until after the death of both
poets were their sonnets published in the collection known as _Tottel's
Miscellany_ (1557). Neither of the poets succeeded in keeping to the
Petrarchan model--an octave and a sestett. Wyatt, it is true, usually
preserves the octave, but breaks up the sestett and finishes with a
couplet. Surrey departs still more widely from his model's strict and
difficult form: his "Sonnet" consists, like Shakespeare's after him,
of three quatrains and a couplet, the rhymes of which are in nowise
interwoven. Sidney, again, preserved the octave, but broke up the
sestett. Spenser attempted a new rhyme-scheme, interweaving the second
and third quatrain, but keeping to the final couplet. Daniel, who is
Shakespeare's immediate predecessor and master, returns to Surrey's
really formless form. The chief defect in Shakespeare's Sonnets as a
metrical whole consists in the appended couplet, which hardly ever
keeps up to the level of the beginning, hardly ever presents any
picture to the eye, but is, as a rule, merely reflective, and often
brings the burst of feeling which animates the poem to a feeble, or at
any rate more rhetorical than poetic, issue.

In actual poetic value the Sonnets are extremely uneven. The first
group as we have already pointed out (p. 270) stands lowest in the
scale, necessarily expressing but little of the poet's personal feeling.

The last two Sonnets in the collection (cliii. and cliv.), dealing
with a conventional theme borrowed from the antique, are likewise
entirely impersonal. W. Hertzberg, having been put on the track by
Herr von Friesen, in 1878 discovered the Greek original of these two
Sonnets in the ninth book of the Palatine Anthology.[9]. The poem
which Shakespeare has adapted, and in Sonnet cliv. almost translated,
was written by the Byzantine scholar Marianus, probably in the fifth
century after Christ; it was published in Latin, among other epigrams,
at Basle in 1529, was retranslated several times before the end of the
sixteenth century, and must have become known to Shakespeare in one or
other of these different forms.

Next in order stand the Sonnets of merely conventional inspiration,
those in which the eye and heart go to law with each other, or in
which the poet plays upon his own name and his friend's. These cannot
possibly claim any high poetic value.

But the poems thus set apart form but a small minority of the
collection. In all the others the waves of feeling run high, and it
may be said in general that the deeper the sentiment and the stronger
the emotion they express, the more admirable is their force of diction
and their marvellous melody. There are Sonnets whose musical quality
is unsurpassed by any of the songs introduced into the plays, or even
by the most famous and beautiful speeches in the plays themselves.
The free and lax form he had adopted was of evident advantage to
Shakespeare. The triple and quadruple rhymes, which in Italian involve
scarcely any difficulty or constraint, would have proved very hampering
in English. As a matter of fact, Shakespeare has been able to follow
out every inspiration unimpeded by the shackles of an elaborate
rhyme-scheme, and has achieved a rare combination of terseness
and harmony in the expression of sorrow, melancholy, anguish, and
resignation. Nothing can be more melodious than the opening of Sonnet
xl., quoted above, or these lines from Sonnet lxxxvi.:--

    "Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
     Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you,
     That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
     Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?"

And how moving is the earnestness of Sonnet cxvi., on faith in love:--

    "Let me not to the marriage of true minds
     Admit impediments. Love is not love
     Which alters when it alteration finds,
     Or bends with the remover to remove:
     O, no! it is an ever-fix�d mark,
     That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;
     It is the star to every wandering bark,
     Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."

Shakespeare's Sonnets are for the general reader the most inaccessible
of his works, but they are also the most difficult to tear oneself away
from. "With this key Shakespeare unlocked his heart," says Wordsworth;
and some people are repelled from them by the _Menschliches_, or, as
they think, _Allzumenschliches_, which is there revealed. They at
any rate hold Shakespeare diminished by his openness. Browning, for
example, thus retorts upon Wordsworth:--

                    "'With this same key
     Shakespeare unlocked his heart' once more!
     Did Shakespeare? If so, the less Shakespeare he."

The reader who can reconcile himself to the fact that great geniuses
are not necessarily models of correctness will pass a very different
judgment. He will follow with eager interest the experiences which
rent and harrowed Shakespeare's soul. He will rejoice in the insight
afforded by these poems, which the crowd ignores, into the tempestuous
emotional life of one of the greatest of men. Here, and here alone,
we see Shakespeare himself, as distinct from his poetical creations,
loving, admiring, longing, yearning, adoring, disappointed, humiliated,
tortured. Here alone does he enter the confessional. Here more than
anywhere else can we, who at a distance of three centuries do homage to
the poet's art, feel ourselves in intimate communion, not only with the
poet, but with the man.


[1] For instance, in Sonnet xxiii.:--

    "O let my books be then the eloquence
     And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
     Who plead for love, and look for recompense."

And in Sonnet xxvi.:--

    "Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
     Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit.

[2] Ludwig von Scheffler: _Michel Angelo. Eine
Renaissancestudie_, 1892.

[3] "E se io non �r� l'arte del navicare per l'onde del mare
del vostro valoroso ingegno, quello mi scuser�, n� si sdegnier� del
mio disaguagliarsigli, n� desiderr� da me quello che in me non �:
perch� chi � solo in ogni cosa, in cosa alcuna non pu� aver compagni.
Per� la vostra Signoria, luce del secol nostro unica al mondo, non puo
sodisfarsi di opera d'alcuno altro, non avendo pari n� simile � s�,"
&c.

[4] "E io non nato, o vero nato morto mi reputerei, e direi in
disgrazia del cielo e della terra, se per la vostra non avessi visto e
creduto vostra Signoria accettare volentieri alcune delle opere mie."
"Avete data la copia de' sopradetti Madrigali a messer Tomaso ... che
se m'uscissi della mente, credo che s�bito cascherei morto."

[5]

    "Accio ch'i' abbi, e non gi� per mie merto,
     desiato mio dolce signiore
     Per sempre nell' indegnie e pronte braccia."

[6] This line, however, is obviously suggested by the famous passage in
_Macbeth_ (Act v.)--

    "My way of life
     Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf."

[7] Several passages in the Sonnets suggest that Pembroke must have
conferred substantial gifts upon Shakespeare--for example, that
expression "wealth" in Sonnet xxxvii., "your bounty" in Sonnet liii.,
and "your own dear-purchased right" in Sonnet cxvii.

[8] "Anzi posso prima dimenticare il cibo di ch'io vivo, che nutrisce
solo il corpo infelicemente, che il nome vostro, che nutrisce il corpo
e l'anima, riempiendo l'uno e l'altro di tanta dolcezza, che n� noia n�
timor di morte, mentre la memoria mi vi serba, posso sentire."

VIII

_JULIUS C�SAR--ITS FUNDAMENTAL DEFECT_

It is afternoon, a little before three o'clock. Whole fleets of
wherries are crossing the Thames, picking their way among the swans
and the other boats, to land their passengers on the south bank of
the river. Skiff after skiff puts forth from the Blackfriars stair,
full of theatre-goers who have delayed a little too long over their
dinner and are afraid of being too late; for the flag waving over the
Globe Theatre announces that there is a play to-day. The bills upon
the street-posts have informed the public that Shakespeare's _Julius
C�sar_ is to be presented, and the play draws a full house. People
pay their sixpences and enter; the balconies and the pit are filled.
Distinguished and specially favoured spectators take their seats on the
stage behind the curtain. Then sound the first, the second, and the
third trumpet-blasts, the curtain parts in the middle, and reveals a
stage entirely hung with black.

Enter the tribunes Flavius and Marullus; they scold the rabble and
drive them home because they are loafing about on a week-day without
their working-clothes and tools--in contravention of a London police
regulation which the public finds so natural that they (and the poet)
can conceive it as in force in ancient Rome. At first the audience is
somewhat restless. The groundlings talk in undertones as they light
their pipes. But the Second Citizen speaks the name of C�sar. There are
cries of "Hush! hush!" and the progress of the play is followed with
eager attention.

It was received with applause, and soon became very popular. Of this
we have contemporary evidence. Leonard Digges, in the poem quoted
above (p. 233), vaunts its scenic attractiveness at the expense of Ben
Jonson's Roman plays:--

    "So have I seene, when Cesar would appeare,
     And on the Stage at halfe-sword parley were
     _Brutus and Cassius_: oh how the Audience
     Were ravish'd, with what new wonder they went thence,
     When some new day they would not brooke a line
     Of tedious (though well laboured) _Catiline_."

The learned rejoiced in the breath of air from ancient Rome which met
them in these scenes, and the populace was entertained and fascinated
by the striking events and heroic characters of the drama. A quatrain
in John Weever's _Mirror of Martyrs, or The Life and Death of Sir Iohn
Oldcastle Knight, Lord Cobham,_ tells how

    "The many-headed multitude were drawne
     By _Brutus_ speech, that _C�sar_ was ambitious,
     When eloquent _Mark Antonie_ had showne
     His vertues, who but _Brutus_ then was vicious?"

There were, indeed, numerous plays on the subject of Julius C�sar--they
are mentioned in Gosson's _Schoole of Abuse_, 1579, in _The Third Blast
of Retraite from Plaies_, 1580, in Henslowe's Diary, 1594 and 1602, in
_The Mirrour of Policie_, 1598, &c.--but Weever's words do not apply
to any of those which have come down to us. It can therefore scarcely
be doubted that they refer to Shakespeare's drama; and as the poem
appeared in 1601, it affords us almost decisive evidence as to the date
of _Julius C�sar_. In all probability, it was in the same year that the
play was written and produced. Weever, indeed, says in his dedication
that his poem was "some two yeares agoe made fit for print;" but even
if this be true, the lines above quoted may quite well have been
inserted later. There are several reasons for believing that _Julius
C�sar_ can scarcely have been produced earlier than 1601. The years
1599 and 1600 are already so full of work that we can scarcely assign
to them this great tragedy as well; and internal evidence indicates
that the play must have been written about the same time as _Hamlet,_
to which its style offers so many striking resemblances.

The immediate success of the play is proved by this fact, among
others, that it at once called forth a rival production on the same
theme. Henslow notes in his diary that in May 1602, on behalf of Lord
Nottingham's company, he paid five pounds for a drama called _C�sar's
Fall_ to the poets Munday, Drayton, Webster, Middleton, and another.
It was evidently written to order. And as _Julius C�sar_, in its
novelty, was unusually successful, so, too, we find it still reckoned
one of Shakespeare's greatest and profoundest plays, unlike the English
"Histories" in standing alone and self-sufficient, characteristically
composed, forming a rounded whole in spite of its apparent scission
at the death of C�sar, and exhibiting a remarkable insight into Roman
character and the life of antiquity.

What attracted Shakespeare to this theme? And, first and foremost, what
_is_ the theme? The play is called _Julius C�sar_, but it was obviously
not C�sar himself that attracted Shakespeare. The true hero of the
piece is Brutus; he it is who has aroused the poet's fullest interest.
We must explain to ourselves the why and wherefore.

The answer is to be found in the point of time at which the play
was written. It was that eventful year when Shakespeare's earliest
friends among the great, Essex and Southampton, had set on foot their
foolhardy conspiracy against Elizabeth, and when their attempted
insurrection had ended in the death of the one, the imprisonment of
the other. He had seen how proud and nobly-disposed characters might
easily be seduced into political error, and tempted to rebellion, on
the plea of independence. It is true that there was little enough
resemblance of detail between the mere palace-revolution designed
by Essex, which should free him from his subjection to the Queen's
incalculable caprices, and the attempt of the Roman patricians to
liberate an aristocratic republic, by assassination, from the yoke of
a newly-founded despotism. The point of resemblance lay in the mere
fact of the imprudent and ill-starred attempt to effect a subversion of
public order.

Add to this the fact that Shakespeare, in the present stage of his
career, displays a certain preference for characters who, in spite of
noble qualities, have fortune against them and are unable to bring
their projects to a successful issue. While he himself was still
fighting for his position, Henry V., the man of practical genius,
the born victor and conqueror, had been his ideal; now that he stood
on firm ground, and was soon to reach the height of his reputation,
he seems to have turned with a sort of melancholy predilection to
characters like Brutus and Hamlet, who, in spite of the highest
endowments, proved unequal to the tasks proposed to them.[1]. They
appealed to him as profound dreamers and high-minded idealists. He
found something of their nature, too, in his own.

A good score of years earlier, in 1579, North's version of Plutarch's
parallel biographies had been published, not translated from the
original, but from the French translation of Amyot. In this book
Shakespeare found his material.

His method of using this material differs considerably from his
treatment of his other authorities. From a chronicler like Holinshed
he, as a rule, takes nothing but the course of events, the outline
of the leading personages and such anecdotes as suit his purpose.
From novelists like Bandello or Cinthio he takes the main lines of
the action, but relies almost entirely on his own invention for the
characters and the dialogue. From the earlier plays, which he adapts
or re-casts, such as _The Taming of a Shrew, King John, The Famous
Victories_ of Henry V., and _King Leir_ (the original _Hamlet_ is
unfortunately not preserved), he transfers into his own work every
scene and speech that is worth anything; but in the cases in which
we can make the comparison, there is little enough that he finds
available. Here, on the other hand, we find a curious and instructive
example of his method of work when he most faithfully followed his
original. We realise that the more developed the art and the more
competent the psychology of the writer before him, the more closely did
Shakespeare tread in his footsteps.

Here for the first time he found himself in touch with a wholly
civilised spirit--not seldom childlike in his antique simplicity, but
still no mean artist. Jean Paul, with some exaggeration, yet not quite
extravagantly, has called Plutarch the biographical Shakespeare of
world-history.

The whole drama of _Julius C�sar_ may be read in Plutarch. Shakespeare
had before him three Lives--those of C�sar, Brutus, and Mark Antony.
Read them consecutively, and you find in them every detail of _Julius
C�sar_.

Let us take some examples from the first act of the play. It begins
with the tribunes' jealousy of the favour in which C�sar stands with
the common people; and everything down to the minutest trait is taken
from Plutarch. The same with what follows: Mark Antony's repeated offer
of the crown to C�sar at the feast of the Lupercal, and his unwilling
refusal of it. So too with C�sar's suspicions of Cassius; C�sar's
speech on his second entrance--

    "Let me have men about me that are fat,
     Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
     Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
     He thinks too much; such men are dangerous,"--

occurs word for word in Plutarch; the anecdote, indeed, made such an
impression on him that he has repeated it three times in different
Lives. We find, furthermore, in the Greek historian, how Cassius
gradually involves Brutus in the conspiracy; how papers exhorting
Brutus to action are thrown into his house; the deliberations as to
whether Antony is to die along with C�sar, and Brutus's mistaken
judgment of Antony's character; Portia's complaint at being excluded
from her husband's confidence; the proof of courage which she gives
by plunging a knife into her thigh; all the omens and prodigies that
precede the murder; the sacrificial ox without a heart; the fiery
warriors fighting in the clouds; Calphurnia's warning dream; C�sar's
determination not to go to the Senate on the Ides of March; Decius
[Decimus] Brutus's endeavour to change his purpose; the fruitless
efforts of Artemidorus to restrain him from facing the danger, etc.,
etc. It is all in Plutarch, point for point.

Here and there we find small and subtle divergences from the original,
which may be traced now to Shakespeare's temperament, now to his
view of life, and again to his design in the play. Plutarch, for
example, has not Shakespeare's contempt for the populace, and does not
make them so senselessly fickle. Then, again, he gives no hint for
Brutus's soliloquy before taking the final resolution (II. I). For
the rest, wherever it is possible, Shakespeare employs the very words
of North's translation. Nay, more, he accepts the characters, such as
Brutus, Portia, Cassius, just as they stand in Plutarch. His Brutus is
absolutely the same as Plutarch's; his Cassius is a man of somewhat
deeper character.

In dealing with the great figure of C�sar, which gives the play
its name, Shakespeare follows faithfully the detached, anecdotic
indications of Plutarch; but he, strangely enough, seems altogether
to miss the remarkable impression we receive from Plutarch of C�sar's
character, which, for the rest, the Greek historian himself was not
in a position fully to understand. We must not forget the fact, of
which Shakespeare of course knew nothing, that Plutarch, who was born
a century after C�sar's death, at a time when the independence of
Greece was only a memory, and the once glorious Hellas was part of a
Roman province, wrote his comparative biographies to remind haughty
Rome that Greece had a great man to oppose to each of her greatest
sons. Plutarch was saturated with the thought that conquered Greece was
Rome's lord and master in every department of the intellectual life.
He delivered Greek lectures in Rome and could not speak Latin, while
every Roman spoke Greek to him and understood it as well as his native
tongue. Significantly enough, Roman literature and poetry do not exist
for Plutarch, though he incessantly cites Greek authors and poets. He
never mentions Virgil or Ovid. He wrote about his great Romans as an
enlightened and unprejudiced Pole might in our days write about great
Russians. He, in whose eyes the old republics shone transfigured, was
not specially fitted to appreciate C�sar's greatness.

Shakespeare, having so arranged his drama that Brutus should be
its tragic hero, had to concentrate his art on placing him in the
foreground, and making him fill the scene. The difficulty was not
to let his lack of political insight (in the case of Antony), or
of practical sense (in his quarrel with Cassius), detract from the
impression of his superiority. He had to be the centre and pivot
of everything, and therefore C�sar was diminished and belittled to
such a degree, unfortunately, that this matchless genius in war and
statesmanship has become a miserable caricature.

We find in other places clear indications that Shakespeare knew very
well what this man was and was worth. Edward's young son, in _Richard
III_., speaks with enthusiasm of C�sar as that conqueror whom death has
not conquered; Horatio, in the almost contemporary _Hamlet_, speaks
of "mightiest Julius" and his death; and Cleopatra, in _Antony and
Cleopatra_, is proud of having been the mistress of C�sar. It is true
that in _As You Like It_ the playful Rosalind uses the expression,
"C�sar's thrasonical brag," with reference to the famous _Veni, vidi,
vici,_ but in an entirely jocose context and acceptation.

But here! here C�sar has become in effect no little of a braggart,
and is compounded, on the whole, of anything but attractive
characteristics. He produces the impression of an invalid. His
liability to the "falling sickness," is emphasised. He is deaf of one
ear. He has no longer his old strength. He faints when the crown is
offered to him. He envies Cassius because he is a stronger swimmer.
He is as superstitious as an old woman. He rejoices in flattery,
talks pompously and arrogantly, boasts of his firmness and is for
ever wavering. He acts incautiously and unintelligently, and does not
realise what threatens him, while every one else sees it clearly.

Shakespeare dared not, says Gervinus, arouse too great interest in
C�sar; he had to throw into relief everything about him that could
account for the conspiracy; and, moreover, he had Plutarch's distinct
statement that C�sar's character had greatly deteriorated shortly
before his death. Hudson practically agrees with this, holding that
Shakespeare wished to present C�sar as he appeared in the eyes of the
conspirators, so that "they too might have fair and equal judgment at
our hands;" admitting, for the rest, that "C�sar was literally too
great to be seen by them," and that "C�sar is far from being himself
in these scenes; hardly one of the speeches put in his mouth can be
regarded as historically characteristic." Thus Hudson arrives at the
astonishing result that "there is an undertone of irony at work in the
ordering and tempering of this composition," explaining that, "when
such a shallow idealist as Brutus is made to overtop and outshine the
greatest practical genius the world ever saw," we are bound to assume
that the intention is ironical.

This is the emptiest cobweb-spinning. There is no trace of irony in
the representation of Brutus. Nor can we fall back upon the argument
that C�sar, after his death, becomes the chief personage of the drama,
and as a corpse, as a memory, as a spirit, strikes down his murderers.
How can so small a man cast so great a shadow! Shakespeare, of course,
intended to show C�sar as triumphing after his death. He has changed
Brutus's evil genius, which appears to him in the camp and at Philippi,
into C�sar's ghost; but this ghost is not sufficient to rehabilitate
C�sar in our estimation.

Nor is it true that C�sar's greatness would have impaired the unity
of the piece. Its poetic value, on the contrary, suffers from his
pettiness. The play might have been immeasurably richer and deeper than
it is, had Shakespeare been inspired by a feeling of C�sar's greatness.

Elsewhere in Shakespeare one marvels at what he has made out of poor
and meagre material. Here, history was so enormously rich, that his
poetry has become poor and meagre in comparison with it.

Just as Shakespeare (if the portions of the first part of _Henry VI_.
which deal with La Pucelle are by him) represented Jeanne d'Arc with
no sense for the lofty and simple poetry that breathed around her
figure--national prejudice and old superstition blinding him--so he
approached the characterisation of C�sar with far too light a heart,
and with imperfect knowledge and care. As he had made Jeanne d'Arc a
witch, so he makes C�sar a braggart. C�sar!

If, like the schoolboys of later generations, he had been given C�sar's
_Gallic War_ to read in his childhood, this would not have been
possible to him. Is it conceivable that, in what he had heard about
the Commentaries, he had na�vely seized upon and misinterpreted the
fact that C�sar always speaks of himself in the third person, and calls
himself by his name?

Let us compare for a moment this posing self-worshipper of
Shakespeare's with the picture of C�sar which the poet might easily
have formed from his Plutarch alone, thus explaining C�sar's rise to
the height of autocracy on which he stands at the beginning of the
play, and at the same time the gradual piling up of the hatred to which
he succumbed. On the very second page of the life of C�sar he must have
read the anecdote of how C�sar, when quite a young man, on his way back
from Bithynia, was taken prisoner by Cilician pirates. They demanded a
ransom of twenty talents (about �4000). He answered that they clearly
did not know who their prisoner was, promised them fifty talents, sent
his attendants to different towns to raise this sum, and remained with
only a friend and two servants among these notoriously bloodthirsty
bandits. He displayed the greatest contempt for them, and freely
ordered them about; he made them keep perfectly quiet when he wanted
to sleep; for the thirty-eight days he remained among them he treated
them as a prince might his bodyguard. He went through his gymnastic
exercises, and wrote poems and orations in the fullest security. He
often assured them that he would certainly have them hanged, or rather
crucified. When the ransom arrived from Miletus, the first use he made
of his liberty was to fit out some ships, attack the pirates, take them
all prisoners, and seize upon their booty. Then he carried them before
the Pr�tor of Asia, Junius, whose business it was to punish them.
Junius, out of avarice, replied that he would take time to reflect
what should be done with the prisoners; whereupon C�sar returned to
Pergamos, where he had left them in prison, and kept his word by having
them all crucified.

What has become of this masterfulness, this grace, and this iron will,
in Shakespeare's C�sar?

                   "I fear him not:
     Yet if my name were liable to fear,
     I do not know the man I should avoid
     So soon as that spare Cassius.
      .    .    .    .    .    .
     I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
     Than what I fear, for always I am C�sar."

It is well that he himself makes haste to say so, otherwise one would
scarcely believe it. And does one believe it, after all?

As Shakespeare conceives the situation, the Republic which C�sar
overthrew might have continued to exist but for him, and it was a
criminal act on his part to destroy it.

But the old aristocratic Republic had already fallen to pieces when
C�sar welded its fragments into a new monarchy. Sheer lawlessness
reigned in Rome. The populace was such as even the rabble of our
own great cities can give no conception of: not the brainless mob,
for the most part tame, only now and then going wild through mere
stupidity, which in Shakespeare listens to the orations over C�sar's
body and tears Cinna to pieces; but a populace whose innumerable hordes
consisted mainly of slaves, together with the thousands of foreigners
from all the three continents, Phrygians from Asia, Negroes from
Africa, Iberians and Celts from Spain and France, who flocked together
in the capital of the world. To the immense bands of house-slaves
and field-slaves, there were added thousands of runaway slaves who
had committed theft or murder at home, lived by robbery on the way,
and now lay hid in the purlieus of the city. But besides foreigners
with no means of support and slaves without bread, there were swarms
of freedmen, entirely corrupted by their servile condition, for whom
freedom, whether combined with helpless poverty or with new-made
riches, meant only the freedom to do harm. Then there were troops of
gladiators, as indifferent to the lives of others as to their own,
and entirely at the beck and call of whoever would pay them. It was
from ruffians of this class that a man like Clodius had recruited
the armed gangs who surrounded him, divided like regular soldiers
into decuries and centuries under duly appointed commanders. These
bands fought battles in the Forum with other bands of gladiators or
of herdsmen from the wild regions of Picenum or Lombardy, whom the
Senate imported for its own protection. There was practically no
street police or fire-brigade. When public disasters happened, such
as floods or conflagrations, people regarded them as portents and
consulted the augurs. The magistrates were no longer obeyed; consuls
and tribunes were attacked, and sometimes even killed. In the Senate
the orators covered each other with abuse, in the Forum they spat in
each other's faces. Regular battles took place on the Campus Martius
at every election, and no man of position ever appeared in the streets
without a bodyguard of gladiators and slaves. "If we try to conceive
to ourselves," wrote Mommsen in 1857, "a London with the slave
population of New Orleans, with the police of Constantinople, with the
non-industrial character of the modern Rome, and agitated by politics
after the fashion of the Paris of 1848, we shall acquire an approximate
idea of the republican glory, the departure of which Cicero and his
associates in their sulky letters deplore."[2]

Compare with this picture Shakespeare's conception of an ambitious
C�sar striving to introduce monarchy into a well-ordered republican
state!

What enchanted every one, even his enemies, who came in contact
with C�sar, was his good-breeding, his politeness, the charm of his
personality. These characteristics made a doubly strong impression upon
those who, like Cicero, were accustomed to the arrogance and coarseness
of Pompey, so-called the Great. However busy he might be, C�sar had
always time to think of his friends and to jest with them. His letters
are gay and amiable. In Shakespeare, when he is not familiar, he is
pompous.

For the space of twenty-five years, C�sar, as a politician, had by
every means in his power opposed the aristocratic party in Rome. He had
early resolved to make himself, without the employment of force, the
master of the then known world, assured as he was that the Republic
would fall to pieces of its own accord. Not until his pr�torship in
Spain had he displayed ability as a soldier and administrator outside
the every-day round of political life. Then suddenly, when everything
seems to be prospering with him, he breaks away from it all, leaves
Rome, and passes into Gaul. At the age of forty-four, he enters upon
his military career, and becomes perhaps the greatest commander known
to history, an unrivalled conqueror and organiser, revealing, in middle
life, a whole host of unsuspected and admirable qualities. Shakespeare
conveys no idea of the wealth and many-sidedness of his gifts. He makes
him belaud himself with unceasing solemnity (II. 2):--

    "C�sar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
     Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
     The face of C�sar, they are vanish�d."

C�sar had nothing of the stolid pomposity and severity which
Shakespeare attributes to him. He united the rapid decision of the
general with the man of the world's elegance and lofty indifference to
trifles. He liked his soldiers to wear glittering weapons and to adorn
themselves. "What does it matter," he said, "though they use perfumes?
They fight none the worse for that." And soldiers who under other
leaders did not surpass the average became invincible under him.

He, who in Rome had been the glass of fashion, was so careless of his
comfort in the field that he often slept under the open sky, and ate
rancid oil without so much as a grimace; but richly-decked tables
always stood in his tents, and all the golden youth, for whom Gaul was
at that time what America became in the days of the first discoverers,
made their way from Rome to his camp. It was the most wonderful camp
ever seen, crowded with men of elegance and learning, young writers and
poets, wits and thinkers, who, in the midst of the greatest and most
imminent dangers, busied themselves with literature, and sent regular
reports of their meetings and conversations to Cicero, the acknowledged
arbiter of the literary world of Rome. During the brief space of
C�sar's expedition into Britain, he writes two letters to Cicero.
Their relation, in its different phases, in some ways reminds us of
the relation between Frederick the Great and Voltaire. What a paltry
picture does Shakespeare draw of Cicero as a mere pedant!--

    "_Cassius_. Did Cicero say anything?

    "_Casca_. Ay, he spoke Greek.

    "_Cassius_. To what effect?

    "_Casca_. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you in
    the face again: but those that understood him smiled at one
    another, and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it
    was Greek to me."

Amid labours of every sort, his life always in danger, incessantly
fighting with warlike enemies, whom he beats in battle after battle,
C�sar writes his grammatical works and his Commentaries. His dedication
to Cicero of his work _De Analogia_ is a homage to literature no less
than to him: "You have discovered all the treasures of eloquence and
been the first to employ them.... You have achieved the crown of all
honours, a triumph the greatest generals may envy; for it is a nobler
thing to remove the barriers of the intellectual life than to extend
the boundaries of the Empire." These are the words of the man who has
just beaten the Helvetii, conquered France and Belgium, made the first
expedition into Britain, and so effectually repelled the German hordes
that they were for long innocuous to the Rome which they had threatened
with destruction.

How little does this C�sar resemble the pompous and highflown puppet of
Shakespeare:--

                "Danger knows full well
     That C�sar is more dangerous than he.
     We are two lions litter'd in one day,
     And I the elder and more terrible."

C�sar could be cruel at times. In his wars, he never shrank from taking
such revenges as should strike terror into his enemies. He had the
whole senate of the Veneti beheaded. He cut the right hand off every
one who had borne arms against him at Uxellodunum. He kept the gallant
Vercingetorix five years in prison, only to exhibit him in chains at
his triumph and then to have him executed.

Yet, where severity was unnecessary, he was tolerance and mildness
itself. Cicero, during the civil war, went over to the camp of Pompey,
and after the defeat of that party sought and received forgiveness.
When he afterwards wrote a book in honour of C�sar's mortal enemy Cato,
who killed himself so as not to have to obey the dictator, and thereby
became the hero of all the republicans, C�sar wrote to Cicero: "In
reading your book, I feel as though I myself had become more eloquent."
And yet in his eyes Cato was only an uncultured personage and a fanatic
for an obsolete order of things. When a slave, out of tenderness for
his master, refused to hand Cato his sword wherewith to kill himself,
Cato gave him such a furious blow in the face that his hand was dyed
with blood. Such a trait must have spoiled for C�sar the impressiveness
of this suicide.

C�sar was not content with forgiving almost all who had borne arms
against him at Pharsalia; he gave many of them, and among the rest
Brutus and Cassius, an ample share of his power. He tried to protect
Brutus before the battle and heaped honours upon him after it. Again
and again Brutus came forward in opposition to C�sar, and even, in
his conscientious quixotism, took part against him with Pompey,
although Pompey had had his father assassinated. C�sar forgave him
this and everything else; he was never tired of forgiving him. He
had, it appears, transferred to Brutus the love of his youth for
Brutus's mother Servilia, Cato's sister, who had been passionately and
faithfully devoted to C�sar. Voltaire, in his _Mort de C�sar_, makes
C�sar hand to Brutus a letter just received from the dying Servilia,
in which she begs C�sar to watch well over their son. Plutarch relates
that on one occasion, at the time of Catiline's conspiracy, a letter
was brought to C�sar in the Senate. Cato, seeing him rise and go
apart to read it, gave open utterance to the suspicion that it was a
missive from the conspirators. C�sar laughingly handed him the letter,
which contained declarations of love from his sister; whereupon Cato,
enraged, burst out with the epithet "Drunkard!"--the direst term of
abuse a Roman could employ. (Ben Jonson has introduced this anecdote in
his _Catiline_, v. 6.)

Brutus inherited his uncle Cato's hatred for C�sar. A certain brutality
was united with a noble stoicism in these two last Roman republicans
of the time of the Republic's downfall. The rawness of antique Rome
survived in Cato's nature, and Brutus, in his conduct towards the
towns of the Asiatic provinces, was nothing but a bloodthirsty usurer,
who, in the name of a man of straw (Scaptius) extorted from them his
exorbitant interests with threats of fire and sword. He had lent to
the inhabitants of the town of Salamis a sum of money at 48 per cent.
On their failure to pay, he kept their Senate so closely besieged by a
squadron of cavalry that five senators died of starvation. Shakespeare,
in his ignorance, attributes no such vices to Brutus, but makes him
simple and great, at C�sar's expense.

C�sar as opposed to Cato--and afterwards as opposed to Brutus--is
the many-sided genius who loves life and action and power, in
contradistinction to the narrow Puritan who hates such emancipated
spirits, partly on principle, partly from instinct.

What a strange misunderstanding that Shakespeare--himself a lover
of beauty, intent on a life of activity, enjoyment, and satisfied
ambition, who always stood to Puritanism in the same hostile relation
in which C�sar stood--should out of ignorance take the side of
Puritanism in this case, and so disqualify himself from extracting from
the rich mine of C�sar's character all the gold contained in it. In
Shakespeare's C�sar we find nothing of the magnanimity and sincerity
of the real man. He never assumed a hypocritical reverence towards the
past, not even on questions of grammar. He grasped at power and seized
it, but did not, as in Shakespeare, pretend to reject it. Shakespeare
has let him keep the pride which he in fact displayed, but has made it
unbeautiful, and eked it out with hypocrisy.

This further trait, too, in C�sar's character Shakespeare has failed
to understand. When at last, after having conquered on every side,
in Africa as in Asia, in Spain as in Egypt, he held in his hands
the sovereign power which had been the object of his twenty years'
struggle, it had lost its attraction for him. Knowing that he was
misunderstood and hated by those whose respect he prized the most,
he found himself compelled to make use of men whom he despised, and
contempt for humanity took possession of his mind. He saw nothing
around him but greed and treachery. Power had lost all its sweetness
for him, life itself was no longer worth living, worth preserving.
Hence his answer when he was besought to take measures against his
would-be assassins: "Rather die once than tremble always!" and he went
to the Senate on the 15th of March without arms and without a guard. In
the tragedy, the motives which ultimately lure him thither are the hope
of a title and a crown, and the fear of being esteemed a coward.

Those foolish persons who attribute Shakespeare's works to Francis
Bacon argue, amongst other things, that such an insight into Roman
antiquity as is manifested in _Julius C�sar_ could be attained by no
one who did not possess Bacon's learning. On the contrary, this play
is obviously written by a man whose learning was in no sense on a
level with his genius, so that its faults, no less than its merits,
afford a proof, however superfluous, that Shakespeare himself was the
author of Shakespeare's works. Bunglers in criticism never realise to
what an extent genius can supply the place of book-learning, and how
vastly greater is its importance. But, on the other hand, one is bound
to declare unequivocally that there are certain domains in which no
amount of genius can compensate for reconstructive insight and study
of recorded fact, and where even the greatest genius falls short when
it tries to create out of its own head, or upon a scanty basis of
knowledge.

Such a domain is that of historical drama, when it deals with periods
and personalities in regard to which recorded fact surpasses all
possible imagination. Where history is stranger and more poetic than
any poetry, more tragic than any antique tragedy, there the poet
requires many-sided insight in order to rise to the occasion. It was
because of Shakespeare's lack of historical and classical culture that
the incomparable grandeur of the figure of C�sar left him unmoved. He
depressed and debased that figure to make room for the development
of the central character in his drama--to wit, Marcus Brutus, whom,
following Plutarch's idealising example, he depicted as a stoic of
almost flawless nobility.

IX

_JULIUS C�SAR--THE MERITS OF THE DRAMA--BRUTUS_

None but a na�ve republican like Swinburne can believe that it was by
reason of any republican enthusiasm in Shakespeare's soul that Brutus
became the leading character. He had assuredly no systematic political
conviction, and manifests at other times the most loyal and monarchical
habit of mind.

Brutus was already in Plutarch the protagonist of the C�sar tragedy,
and Shakespeare followed the course of history as represented by
Plutarch, under the deep impression that an impolitic revolt, like
that of Essex and his companions, can by no means stem the current
of the time, and that practical errors revenge themselves quite as
severely as moral sins--nay, much more so. The psychologist was now
awakened in him, and he found it a fascinating task to analyse and
present a man who finds a mission imposed upon him for which he is by
nature unfitted. It is no longer outward conflicts like that in _Romeo
and Juliet_ between the lovers and their surroundings, or in _Richard
III._, between Richard and the world at large, that fascinate him in
this new stage of his development, but the inner processes and crises
of the spiritual life.

Brutus has lived among his books and fed his mind upon Platonic
philosophy; therefore he is more occupied with the abstract political
idea of republican freedom, and the abstract moral conception of the
shame of enduring a despotism, than with the actual political facts
before his eyes, or the meaning of the changes which are going on
around him. This man is vehemently urged by Cassius to place himself at
the head of a conspiracy against his fatherly benefactor and friend.
The demand throws his whole nature into a ferment, disturbs its
harmony, and brings it for ever out of equilibrium.

On Hamlet also, who is at the same time springing to life in
Shakespeare's mind, the spirit of his murdered father imposes the duty
of becoming an assassin, and the claim acts as a stimulus, a spur to
his intellectual faculties, but as a solvent to his character; so
close is the resemblance between the situation of Brutus, with his
conflicting duties, and the inward strife which we are soon to find in
Hamlet.

Brutus is at war with himself, and therefore forgets to show others
attention and the outward signs of friendship. His comrades summon him
to action, but he hears no answering summons from within. As Hamlet
breaks out into the well known words:--

    "The time is out of joint:--O, cursed spite
     That ever I was born to set it right!"

so also Brutus shrinks with horror from his task. He says (I. 2):--

    "Brutus had rather be a villager
     Than to repute himself a son of Rome
     Under these hard conditions as this time
     Is like to lay upon us."

His noble nature is racked by these doubts and uncertainties.

From the moment Cassius has spoken to him, he is sleepless. The rugged
Macbeth becomes sleepless after he has killed the King--"Macbeth has
murdered sleep." Brutus, with his delicate, reflective nature, bent
on obeying only the dictates of duty, is calm after the murder, but
sleepless before it. His preoccupation with the idea has altered
his whole manner of being; his wife does not know him again. She
tells how he can neither converse nor sleep, but strides up and down
with his arms folded, sighing and lost in thought, does not answer
her questions, and, when she repeats them, waves her off with rough
impatience.

It is not only his gratitude to C�sar that keeps Brutus in torment;
it is especially his uncertainty as to what C�sar's intentions really
are. Brutus sees him, indeed, idolised by the people and endowed
with supreme power; but as yet C�sar has never abused it. He concurs
with Cassius's view that when C�sar declined the crown he in reality
hankered after it; but, after all, they have nothing to go upon but his
supposed desire:--

                    "To speak truth of C�sar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder."

If C�sar is to be slain, then, it is not for what he has done, but for
what he may do in the future. Is it permissible to commit a murder upon
such grounds?

In Hamlet we find this variant of the difficulty: Is it certain that
the king murdered Hamlet's father? May not the ghost have been a
hallucination, or the devil himself?

Brutus feels the weakness of his basis of action the more clearly
the more he leans towards the murder as a political duty. And
Shakespeare has not hesitated to attribute to him, high-minded as he
is, that doctrine of expediency, so questionable in the eyes of many,
which declares that a necessary end sanctifies impure means. Two
separate times, once when he is by himself, and once in addressing the
conspirators, he recommends political hypocrisy as judicious and
serviceable. In the soliloquy he says (II. I):--

                 "And, since the quarrel
     Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
     Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
     Would run to these and these extremities."

To the conspirators his words are:--

    "And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
     Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
     And after seem to chide 'em."

That is to say, the murder is to be carried out with as much decency as
possible, and the murderers are afterwards to pretend that they deplore
it.

As soon as the murder is resolved upon, however, Brutus, assured of
the purity of his motives, stands proud and almost unconcerned in the
midst of the conspirators. Far too unconcerned, indeed; for though he
has not shrunk in principle from the doctrine that one cannot will the
end without willing the means, he yet shrinks, upright and unpractical
as he is, from employing means which seem to him either too base or too
unscrupulous. He will not even suffer the conspirators to be bound by
oath: "Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous." They are to trust
each other without the assurance of an oath, and to keep their secret
unsworn. And when it is proposed that Antony shall be killed along with
C�sar, a necessary step, to which, as a politician, he was bound to
consent, he rejects it, in Shakespeare as in Plutarch, out of humanity:
"Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius." He feels that his
will is as clear as day, and suffers at the thought of employing the
methods of night and darkness:

                        "O Conspiracy!
    Sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then, by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage?"

Brutus is anxious that a cause which is to be furthered by
assassination should achieve success without secrecy and without
violence. Goethe has said: "Only the man of reflection has a
conscience." The man of action cannot have one while he is acting. To
plunge into action is to place oneself at the mercy of one's nature
and of external powers. One acts rightly or wrongly, but always upon
instinct--often stupidly, sometimes, it may be, brilliantly, never with
full consciousness. Action implies the in considerateness of instinct,
or egoism, or genius; Brutus, on the other hand, is bent on acting with
every consideration.

Kreyssig, and after him Dowden, have called Brutus a Girondin, in
opposition to his brother-in-law, Cassius, a sort of Jacobin in antique
dress. The comparison is just only in regard to the lesser or greater
inclination to the employment of violent means; it halts when we
reflect that Brutus lives in the rarefied air of abstractions, face to
face with ideas and principles, while Cassius lives in the world of
facts; for the Jacobins were quite as stiff-necked theorists as any
Girondin. Brutus, in Shakespeare, is a strict moralist, excessively
cautious lest any stain should mar the purity of his character, while
Cassius does not in the least aspire to moral flawlessness. He is
frankly envious of C�sar, and openly avows that he hates him; yet
he is not base; for envy and hatred are in his case swallowed up by
political passion, strenuous and consistent. And, unlike Brutus, he
is a good observer, looking right through men's words and actions
into their souls. But as Brutus is the man whose name, birth, and
position as C�sar's intimate friend, point him out to be the head
of the conspiracy, he is always able to enforce his impolitic and
short-sighted will.

When we find that Hamlet, who is so full of doubts, never for a moment
doubts his right to kill the king, we must remember that Shakespeare
had just exhausted this theme in his characterisation of Brutus.

Brutus is the ideal whom Shakespeare, like all men of the better sort,
cherished in his soul--the man whose pride it is before everything to
keep his hands clean and his mind high and free, even at the cost of
failure in his undertakings and the wreck of his tranquillity and of
his fortunes.

He does not care to impose an oath upon the others; he is too proud.
If they want to betray him, let them! These others, it is true, may
be moved by their hatred of the great man, and eager to quench their
malice in his blood; he, for his part, admires him, and will sacrifice,
not butcher him. The others fear the consequences of suffering Antony
to address the people; but Brutus has explained to the people his
reasons for the murder, so Antony may now eulogise C�sar as much as
he pleases. Did not C�sar deserve eulogy? Does not he himself desire
that C�sar shall lie honoured, though punished, in his grave? He is too
proud to keep a watch upon Antony, who has approached him in friendly
fashion, though at the same time in the character of C�sar's friend;
therefore he leaves the Forum before Antony begins his speech. Such
moods are familiar to many. Many another has acted in this apparently
unwise way, proudly reckless of consequences, moved by the dislike
of the magnanimous man for all that savours of base cautiousness.
Many a one, for example, has told the truth where it was stupid to
do so, or has let slip an opportunity of revenge because he despised
his enemy too much to seek compensation for his injuries, though he
thereby neglected to render him innocuous for the future. An intense
realisation of the necessity for confidence, or, on the other hand, of
the untrustworthiness of friends and the contemptibleness of enemies,
may easily lead one to despise every measure of prudence.

It was upon the basis of an intense feeling of this nature that
Shakespeare created Brutus. With the addition of humour and a touch of
genius he would be Hamlet, and he becomes Hamlet. With the addition of
despairing bitterness and misanthropy he would be Timon, and he becomes
Timon. Here he is the man of uncompromising character and principle,
who is too proud to be prudent and too bad an observer to be practical;
and this man is so situated that not only the life and death of another
and of himself, but the welfare of the State, and even, as it appears,
that of the whole civilised world, depend upon the resolution at which
he arrives.

At Brutus's side Shakespeare places the figure which forms his female
counterpart, the kindred spirit who has become one with him, his cousin
and wife, Cato's daughter married to Cato's disciple. He has here, and
here alone, given us a picture of the ideal marriage as he conceived it.

In the scene between Brutus and Portia the poet takes up afresh a
motive which he has handled once before--the anxious wife beseeching
her husband to initiate her into his great designs. It first appears
in _Henry IV_., Part I., where Lady Percy implores her Harry to let
her share his counsels. (See above, p. 189) The description which she
gives of Hotspur's manner and conduct exactly corresponds to Portia's
description of the transformation which has taken place in Brutus. Both
husbands, indeed, are nursing a similar project. But Lady Percy learns
nothing. Her Harry no doubt loves her, loves her now and then, between
two skirmishes, briskly and gaily; but there is no sentiment in his
love for her, and he never dreams of any spiritual communion between
them.

When Portia, in this case, begs her husband to tell her what is
weighing on his mind, he at first, indeed, replies with evasions about
his health; but on her vehemently declaring that she feels herself
degraded by this lack of confidence (Shakespeare has but slightly
softened the antique frankness of the words which Plutarch places
in her mouth), Brutus answers her with warmth and beauty. And when
(again as in Plutarch) she tells of the proof she has given of her
steadfastness by thrusting a knife into her thigh and never complaining
of the "voluntary wound," he bursts forth with the words which Plutarch
places in his mouth:--

    "O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife,"

and promises to tell her everything.

Neither Shakespeare nor Plutarch, however, regards his facile
communicativeness as a mark of prudence. For it is not Portia's fault
that it does not betray everything. When it comes to the point, she can
neither hold her tongue nor control herself. She betrays her anxiety
and uneasiness to the boy Lucius, and herself exclaims:--

    "I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
     How hard it is for women to keep counsel!"

This reflection is obviously not Portia's, but an utterance of
Shakespeare's own philosophy of life, which he has not cared to keep to
himself. In Plutarch she even falls down as though dead, and the news
of her death surprises Brutus just before the time appointed for the
murder of C�sar, so that he needs all his self-control to save himself
from breaking down.

From the character with which Shakespeare has thus endowed Brutus
spring the two great scenes which carry the play.

The first is the marvellously-constructed scene, the turning-point of
the tragedy, in which Antony, speaking with Brutus's consent over the
body of C�sar, stirs up the Romans against the murderers of the great
imperator.

Even Brutus's own speech Shakespeare has moulded with the rarest
art. Plutarch relates that when Brutus wrote Greek he cultivated a
"compendious" and laconic style, of which the historian adduces a
string of examples. He wrote to the Samians: "Your councels be long,
your doings be slow; consider the end." And in another epistle: "The
Xanthians, despising my good wil, haue made a graue of dispaire; and
the Patareians, that put themselves into my protection, have lost no
iot of their liberty: and therefore whilst you haue libertie, either
chuse the iudgement of the Patareians or the fortune of the Xanthians."
See now, what Shakespeare has made out of these indications:--

    "Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause, and
    be silent, that you may hear: believe me for mine honour,
    and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe.
    ... If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
    C�sar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to C�sar was no
    less than his. If, then, that friend demand, why Brutus rose
    against C�sar, this is my answer:--Not that I loved C�sar
    less, but that I loved Rome more."

And so on, in this style of laconic antithesis. Shakespeare has made a
deliberate effort to assign to Brutus the diction he had cultivated,
and, with his inspired faculty of divination, has, as it were,
reanimated it:--

    "As C�sar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I
    rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him: but, as he
    was ambitious, I slew him."

With ingenious and yet noble art the speech culminates in the question,
"Who is here so vile that will not love his country! If any, speak; for
him have I offended." And when the crowd answers, "None, Brutus, none,"
he chimes in with the serene assurance, "Then none have I offended."

The still more admirable oration of Antony is in the first place
remarkable for the calculated difference of style which it displays.
Here we have no antitheses, no literary eloquence; but a vernacular
eloquence of the most powerful demagogic type. Antony takes up the
thread just where Brutus has dropped it, expressly assures his hearers
at the outset that this is to be a speech over C�sar's bier, but
not to his glory, and emphasises to the point of monotony the fact
that Brutus and the other conspirators are all, all honourable men.
Then the eloquence gradually works up, subtle and potent, in its
adroit crescendo, and yet in truth exalted by something which is not
subtlety: glowing enthusiasm for C�sar, scathing indignation against
his assassins. The contempt and anger are at first masked, out of
consideration for the mood of the populace, which has for the moment
been won over by Brutus; then the mask is raised a little, then a
little more and a little more, until, with a wild gesture, it is torn
off and thrown aside.

Here again Shakespeare has utilised in a masterly fashion the hints he
found in Plutarch, scanty as they were:--

    "Afterwards, when C�sar's body was brought into the
    market-place, Antonius, making his funeral oration in praise
    of the dead, according to the auncient custome of Rome,
    and perceiuing that his words moued the common people to
    compassion: he framed his eloquence to make their harts
    yerne the more."

Mark what Shakespeare has made of this::--

    "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:
     I come to bury C�sar, not to praise him.
     The evil that men do lives after them,
     The good is oft interred with their bones;
     So let it be with C�sar. The noble Brutus
     Hath told you, C�sar was ambitious:
     If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
     And grievously hath C�sar answered it.
     Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
     (For Brutus is an honourable man,
     So are they all, all honourable men),
     Come I to speak in C�sar's funeral.
     He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
     But Brutus says he was ambitious;
     And Brutus is an honourable man."

Then Antony goes on to insinuate doubts as to C�sar's ambition, and
tells how he rejected the kingly diadem, rejected it three times. Was
this ambition? Thereupon he suggests that C�sar, after all, was once
beloved, and that there is no reason why he should not be mourned. Then
with a sudden outburst:--

    "O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
     And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
     My heart is in the coffin there with C�sar,
     And I must pause till it come back to me."

Next comes an appeal to their pity for this greatest of men, whose
word but yesterday might have stood against the world, and who now
lies so low that the poorest will not do him reverence. It would be
wrong to make his speech inflammatory, a wrong towards Brutus and
Cassius "who--as you know--are honourable men" (mark the jibe in the
parenthetic phrase); no, he will rather do wrong to the dead and to
himself. But here he holds a parchment--he assuredly will not read
it--but if the people came to know its contents they would kiss dead
C�sar's wounds, and dip their handkerchiefs in his sacred blood. And
then, when cries for the reading of the will mingle with curses upon
the murderers, he stubbornly refuses to read it. Instead of doing so,
he displays to them C�sar's cloak with all the rents in it.

What Plutarch says here is:--

    "To conclude his Oration, he unfolded before the whole
    assembly the bloudy garments of the dead, thrust through in
    many places with their swords, and called the malefactors
    cruell and cursed murtherers."

Out of these few words Shakespeare has made this miracle of invective:--

    "You all do know this mantle! I remember
     The first time ever C�sar put it on:
     'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
     That day he overcame the Nervii.
     Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
     See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
     Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
     And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
     Mark how the blood of C�sar followed it,
     As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd
     If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
     For Brutus, as you know, was C�sar's angel.
     Judge, O you gods, how dearly C�sar lov'd him!
     This was the most unkindest cut of all;
     For when the noble C�sar saw him stab,
     Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
     Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
     And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
     Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
     Which all the while ran blood, great C�sar fell.
     O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
     Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
     Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
     O! now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
     The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
     Kind souls! what, weep you, when you but behold
     Our C�sar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
     Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors."

He uncovers C�sar's body; and not till then does he read the will,
overwhelming the populace with gifts and benefactions. This climax is
of Shakespeare's own invention.

No wonder that even Voltaire was so struck with the beauty of this
scene, that for its sake he translated the first three acts of the
play. At the end of his own _Mort de C�sar_, too, he introduced a
feeble imitation of the scene; and he had it in his mind when, in his
_Discours sur la Trag�die_, dedicated to Bolingbroke, he expressed so
much enthusiasm and envy for the freedom of the English stage.

In the last two acts, Brutus is overtaken by the recoil of his deed.
He consented to the murder out of noble, disinterested and patriotic
motives; nevertheless he is struck down by its consequences, and pays
for it with his happiness and his life. The declining action of the
last two acts is--as is usual with Shakespeare--less effective and
fascinating than the rising action which fills the first three; but it
has one significant, profound, and brilliantly constructed and executed
scene--the quarrel and reconciliation between Brutus and Cassius in the
fourth act, which leads up to the appearance of C�sar's ghost.

This scene is significant because it gives a many-sided picture of the
two leading characters--the sternly upright Brutus, who is shocked at
the means employed by Cassius to raise the money without which their
campaign cannot be carried on, and Cassius, a politician entirely
indifferent to moral scruples, but equally unconcerned as to his own
personal advantage. The scene is profound because it presents to us the
necessary consequences of the law-defying, rebellious act: cruelty,
unscrupulous policy, and lax tolerance of dishonourable conduct in
subordinates, when the bonds of authority and discipline have once been
burst. The scene is brilliantly constructed because, with its quick
play of passion and its rising discord, which at last passes over into
a cordial and even tender reconciliation, it is dramatic in the highest
sense of the word.

The fact that Brutus was in Shakespeare's own mind the true hero of the
tragedy appears in the clearest light when we find him ending the play
with the eulogy which Plutarch, in his life of Brutus, places in the
mouth of Antony; I mean the famous words:--

    "This was the noblest Roman of them all:
     All the conspirators, save only he,
     Did that they did in envy of great C�sar;
     He only, in a general honest thought
     And common good to all, made one of them.
     His life was gentle; and the elements
     So mixed in him that Nature might stand up,
     And say to all the world, 'This was a man!'"

The resemblance between these words and a celebrated speech of Hamlet's
is unmistakable. Everywhere in _Julius C�sar_ we feel the proximity of
_Hamlet_. The fact that Hamlet hesitates so long before attacking the
King, finds so many reasons to hold his hand, is torn with doubts as
to the act and its consequences, and insists on considering everything
even while he upbraids himself for considering so long--all this is
partly due, no doubt, to the circumstance that Shakespeare comes to
him directly from Brutus. His Hamlet has, so to speak, just seen what
happened to Brutus, and the example is not encouraging, either with
respect to action in general, or with respect to the murder of a
stepfather in particular.

It is not difficult to conceive that Shakespeare may at this period
have been subject to moments of scepticism, in which he could scarcely
understand how any one could make up his mind to act, to assume
responsibility, to set in motion the rolling stone which is the type
of every action. If we once begin to brood over the incalculable
consequences of an action and all that circumstance may make of it,
all action on a great scale becomes impossible. Therefore it is that
very few old men understand their youth; they dare not and could not
act again as, in their recklessness of consequences, they acted then.
Brutus forms the transition to Hamlet, and Hamlet no doubt grew up in
Shakespeare's mind during the working out of _Julius C�sar_.

The stages of transition are perhaps these: the conspirators, in egging
Brutus on to the murder, are always reminding him of the elder Brutus,
who pretended madness and drove out the Tarquins. This may have led
Shakespeare to dwell upon his character as drawn by Livy, which had
always been exceedingly popular. But Brutus the elder is an antique
Hamlet; and the very name of Hamlet, as he found it in the older play
and in Saxo, seems always to have haunted Shakespeare. It was the name
he had given to the little boy whom he lost so early.




X

_BEN JONSON AND HIS ROMAN PLAYS_

In precisely the same year as Shakespeare, his famous brother-poet,
Ben Jonson, made his first attempt at a dramatic presentation of Roman
antiquity. His play, _The Poetaster_, was written and acted in 1601.
Its purpose is the literary annihilation of two playwrights, Marston
and Dekker, with whom the author was at feud; but its action takes
place in the time of Augustus; and Jonson, in spite of his satire on
contemporaries, no doubt wanted to utilise his thorough knowledge
of ancient literature in giving a true picture of Roman manners. As
Shakespeare's _Julius C�sar_ was followed by two other tragedies of
antique Rome, _Antony and Cleopatra_ and _Coriolanus_, so Ben Jonson
also wrote two other plays on Roman themes, the tragedies of _Sejanus_
and _Catiline_. It is instructive to compare his method of treatment
with Shakespeare's; but a general comparison of the two creative
spirits must precede this comparison of artistic processes in a single
limited field.

Ben Jonson was nine years younger than Shakespeare, born in 1573, a
month after the death of his father, the son of a clergyman whose
forefathers had belonged to "the gentry." He was a child of the town,
while Shakespeare was a child of the country; and the fact is not
without significance, though town and country were not then so clearly
opposed to each other as they are now. When Ben was two years old,
his mother married a worthy masterbricklayer, who did what he could
to procure his step-son a good education, so that, after passing some
years at a small private school, he was sent to Westminster. Here
the learned William Camden, his teacher, introduced him to the two
classical literatures, and seems, moreover, to have exercised a not
altogether fortunate influence upon his subsequent literary habits; for
it was Camden who taught him first to write out in prose whatever he
wanted to express in verse. Thus the foundation was laid at school, not
only of his double ambition to shine as a scholar and a poet, or rather
as a scholar-poet, but also of his heavy and rhetorically emphatic
verse.

In spite of his worship of learning, his dislike to all handicraft, and
his unfitness for practical work, he was forced by poverty to break
off his studies in order to enter the employment of his bricklayer
stepfather--a fact which, in his subsequent literary feuds, always
procured him the nickname of "the bricklayer." He could not long endure
this occupation, went as a soldier to the Netherlands, killed one of
the enemy in single combat, under the eyes of both camps, returned to
London and married--almost as early as Shakespeare--at the age of only
nineteen. Twenty-six years later, in his conversations with Drummond,
he called his wife "a shrew, yet honest." He seems to have been an
affectionate father, but had the misfortune to survive his children.

He was strong and massive in body, racy and coarse, full of self-esteem
and combative instincts, saturated with the conviction of the scholar's
high rank and the poet's exalted vocation, full of contempt for
ignorance, frivolity, and lowness, classic in his tastes, with a bent
towards careful structure and leisurely development of thought in
all that he wrote, and yet a true poet in so far as he was not only
irregular in his life and quite incapable of saving any of the money he
now and then earned, but was, moreover, subject to hallucinations: once
saw Carthaginians and Romans fighting on his great toe, and, on another
occasion, had a vision of his son with a bloody cross on his brow,
which was supposed to forbode his death.

Like Shakespeare, he sought to make his bread by entering the theatre
and appearing as an actor. To him, as to Shakespeare, old pieces of the
repertory were entrusted to be rewritten, expanded, and furbished up.
Thus as late as 1601-2 he made a number of very able additions, in the
style of the old play, to that _Spanish Tragedy_ of Kyd's, which must
in many ways have been in Shakespeare's mind during the composition of
_Hamlet_.

He did this work on the commission of Henslow, for whose company, which
competed with Shakespeare's, he worked regularly from 1597 onwards. He
collaborated with Dekker in a tragedy, and had a hand in other plays;
in short, he made himself useful to the theatre as best he could, but
did not, like Shakespeare, acquire a share in the enterprise, and thus
never became a man of substance. He was to the end of his life forced
to rely for his income upon the liberality of royal and noble patrons.

The end of 1598 is doubly significant in Ben Jonson's life. In
September he killed in a duel another of Henslow's actors, a certain
Gabriel Spencer (who seems to have challenged him), and was therefore
branded on the thumb with the letter T (Tyburn). A couple of months
later, this occurrence having evidently led to a break in his
connection with Henslow's company, his first original play, _Every Man
in his Humour_, was acted by the Lord Chamberlain's men. According to a
tradition preserved by Rowe, and apparently trustworthy, the play had
already been refused, when Shakespeare happened to see it and procured
its acceptance. It met with the success it deserved, and henceforward
the author's name was famous.

Even in the first edition of this play he makes Young Knowell speak
with warm enthusiasm of poetry, of the dignity of the sacred art of
invention, and express that hatred for every profanation of the Muses
which appears so frequently in later works, finding, perhaps, its most
vehement utterance in _The Poetaster_, where the young Ovid eulogises
his art in opposition to the scorn of his father and others. From the
first, too, he made no concealment of his strong sense of being at once
a high-priest of art, and, in virtue of his learning, an Aristarchus
of taste. He not only scorned all attempts to tickle the public ear,
but, with the firm and superior attitude of a teacher, he again and
again imprinted on spectators and readers what Goethe has expressed
in the well-known words: "Ich schreibe nicht, Euch zu gefallen; Ihr
sollt was lernen." Again and again he claimed for his own person the
sanctity and inviolability of art, and attacked his inferior rivals
unsparingly, with ferocious rather than witty satire. His prologues and
epilogues are devoted to a self-acclamation which was entirely foreign
to Shakespeare's nature. Asper in _Every Man out of his Humour_ (1599),
Crites in _Cynthia's Revels_ (1600), and Horace in _The Poetaster_
(1601), are so many pieces of self-idolising self-portraiture.

All who, in his judgment, degrade art are made to pay the penalty
in scathing caricatures. In _The Poetaster_, for example, his
taskmaster, Henslow, is presented under the name of Histrio as a
depraved slave-dealer, and his colleagues Marston and Dekker are
held up to ridicule under Roman names, as intrusive and despicable
scribblers. Their attacks upon the admirable poet Horace, whose name
and personality the extremely dissimilar Ben Jonson has arrogated to
himself, spring from contemptible motives, and receive a disgraceful
punishment.

This whole warfare must not be taken too seriously. The worthy
Ben could be at the same time an indignant moralist and a genial
boon-companion. We presently find him taking service afresh with the
very Henslow whom he has just treated with such withering contempt;
and though his attack of 1601 had been met by a most malicious retort
in Marston and Dekker's _Satiromastix_, he, three years afterwards,
accepts the dedication of Marston's _Malcontent_, and in 1605
collaborates with this lately-lampooned colleague and with Chapman in
the comedy of _Eastward Ho!_ One could not but think of the German
proverb, "Pack schlagt sich, Pack vertragt sich," were it not that
Jonson's action at this juncture reveals him in anything but a vulgar
light. Marston and Chapman having been thrown into prison for certain
gibes at the Scotch in this play, which had come to the notice of the
King, and being reported to be in danger of having their noses and
ears cut off, Ben Jonson, of his own free will, claimed his share
in the responsibility and joined them in prison. At a supper which,
after their liberation, he gave to all his friends, his mother clinked
glasses with him, and at the same time showed him a paper, the contents
of which she had intended to mix with his drink in prison if he had
been sentenced to mutilation. She added that she herself would not have
survived him, but would have taken her share of the poison. She must
have been a mother worthy of such a son.

While Ben lay in durance on account of his duel, he had been converted
to Catholicism by a priest who attended him--a conversion at which his
adversaries did not fail to jeer. He does not seem, however, to have
embraced the Catholic dogma with any great fervour, for twelve years
later he once more changes his religion and returns to the Protestant
Church. Equally characteristic of Ben and of the Renaissance is his own
statement, preserved for us by Drummond, that at his first communion
after his reconciliation with Protestantism, in token of his sincere
return to the doctrine which gave laymen, as well as priests access to
the chalice, he drained at one draught the whole of the consecrated
wine.

Not without humour, moreover--to use Jonson's own favourite word--is
his story of the way in which Raleigh's son, to whom he acted as
governor during a tour in France (while Raleigh himself was in
the Tower), took a malicious pleasure in making his mentor dead
drunk, having him wheeled in a wheelbarrow through the streets of
Paris, and showing him off to the mob at every street corner. Ben's
strong insistence on his spiritual dignity was not infrequently
counterbalanced by an extreme carelessness of his personal dignity.

With all his weaknesses, however, he was a sturdy, energetic, and
high-minded man, a commanding, independent, and very comprehensive
intelligence; and from 1598, when he makes his first appearance on
Shakespeare's horizon, throughout the rest of his life, he was, so
far as we can see, the man of all his contemporaries whose name was
oftenest mentioned along with Shakespeare's. In after days, especially
outside England, the name of Ben Jonson has come to sound small enough
in comparison with the name of solitary greatness with which it was
once bracketed; but at that time, although Jonson was never so popular
as Shakespeare, they were commonly regarded in literary circles as the
dramatic twin-brethren of the age. For us it is still more interesting
to remember that Ben Jonson was one of the few with whom we know that
Shakespeare was on terms of constant familiarity, and, moreover, that
he brought to this intercourse a set of definite artistic principles,
widely different from Shakespeare's own. Though his society may
have been somewhat fatiguing, it must nevertheless have been both
instructive and stimulating to Shakespeare, since Ben was greatly his
superior in historical and linguistic knowledge, while as a poet he
pursued a totally different ideal.

Ben Jonson was a great dramatic intelligence. He never, like the other
poets of his time, took this or that novel and dramatised it as it
stood, regardless of its more or less incoherent structure, its more or
less flagrant defiance of topographical, geographical, or historical
reality. With architectural solidity--was he not the step-son of a
master-builder?--he built up his dramatic plan out of his own head,
and, being a man of great learning, he did his best to avoid all
incongruities of local colour. If he is now and then negligent in this
respect--if the characters in _Volpone_ now and then talk as if they
were in London, not in Venice, and those in _The Poetaster_ as if they
were in England, not in Rome--it is because of his satiric purpose, and
not at all by reason of the indifference to such considerations which
characterises all other dramatists of the time, Shakespeare not the
least.

The fundamental contrast between them can be most shortly expressed
in the statement that Ben Jonson accepted the view of human nature
set forth in the classic comedies and the Latin tragedies. He
does not represent it as many-sided, with inward developments and
inconsistencies, but fixes character in typical forms, with one
dominant trait thrown into high relief. He portrays, for example, the
crafty parasite, or the eccentric who cannot endure noise, or the
braggart captain, or the depraved anarchist (Catiline), or the stern
man of honour (Cato)--and all these personalities are neither more nor
less than the labels imply, and act up to their description always and
in all circumstances. The pencil with which he draws is hard, but he
wields it with such power that his best outlines subsist through the
centuries, unforgettable, despite their occasional oddity of design,
in virtue of the indignation with which wickedness and meanness
are branded, and the racy merriment with which the caricatures are
sketched, the farces worked out.

Some of Moli�re's farces may now and then remind us of Jonson's, but,
as regards the pitiless intensity of the satire, we shall find no
counterpart to his _Volpone_ until we come in our own times to Gogol's
_Revisor_.

The Graces stood by Shakespeare's cradle, not by Jonson's; and yet this
heavy-armed warrior has now and then attained to grace as well--has now
and then given a holiday to his sound systematic intelligence and his
solidly-constructed logic, and, like a true poet of the Renaissance,
soared into the rarer atmosphere of pure fantasy.

He shows himself very much at home in the allegorical masques which
were performed at court festivals; and in the pastoral play _The
Sad Shepherd_ which seems to have been written upon his death-bed,
he proved that even in the purely romantic style he could challenge
comparison with the best writers of his day. Yet it is not in this
sphere that he displays his true originality. It is in his keen and
faithful observation of the conditions and manners of his time, which
Shakespeare left on one side, or depicted only incidentally and
indirectly. The London of Elizabeth lives again in Jonson's plays; both
the lower and higher circles, but especially the lower: the haunters of
taverns and theatres, the men of the riverside and the markets, rogues
and vagabonds, poets and players, watermen and jugglers, bear-leaders
and hucksters, rich city dames, Puritan fanatics and country squires,
English oddities of every class and kind, each speaking his own
language, dialect, or jargon. Shakespeare never kept so close to the
life of the day.

It is especially Johnson's scholarship that must have made his
society full of instruction for Shakespeare. Ben's acquirements were
encyclop�dic, and his acquaintance with the authors of antiquity was
singularly complete and accurate. It has often been remarked that he
was not content with an exhaustive knowledge of the leading writers
of Greece and Rome. He knows not only the great historians, poets,
and orators, such as Tacitus and Sallust, Horace, Virgil, Ovid, and
Cicero, but sophists, grammarians, and scholiasts, men like Athen�us,
Libanius, Philostratus, Strabo, Photius. He is familiar with fragments
of �olic lyrists and Roman epic poets, of Greek tragedies and Roman
inscriptions; and, what is still more remarkable, he manages to make
use of all his knowledge. Whatever in the ancients he found beautiful
or profound or stimulating, that he wove into his work. Dryden says of
him in his "Essay of Dramatic Poesy":--

    "The greatest man of the last age (Ben Jonson) was willing
    to give place to the ancients in all things: he was not only
    a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned plagiary of
    all the others; you track him everywhere in their snow. If
    Horace, Lucan, Petronius Arbiter, Seneca, and Juvenal had
    their own from him, there are few serious thoughts which are
    new in him.... But he has done his robberies so openly, that
    one may see he fears not to be taxed by any law. He invades
    authors like a monarch; and what would be theft in other
    poets is only victory in him."

Certain it is that an uncommon learning and an extraordinary memory
supplied him with an immense store of small touches, poetical and
rhetorical details, which he could not refrain from incorporating in
his plays.

Yet his mass of learning was not of a merely verbal or rhetorical
nature; he knew things as well as words. Whatever subject he treats of,
be it alchemy, or witchcraft, or cosmetics in the time of Tiberius, he
handles it with competence and has its whole literature at his fingers'
ends. He thus becomes universal like Shakespeare, but in a different
way. Shakespeare knows, firstly, all that cannot be learnt from books,
and in the second place, whatever can be gleaned by genius from a
casual utterance, an intelligent hint, a conversation with a man of
high acquirements. Besides this, he knows the literature which was at
that time within the reach of a quick-witted and studious man without
special scholarship. Ben Jonson, on the other hand, is a scholar by
profession. He has learnt from books all that the books of his day--for
the most part, of course, the not too numerous survivals of the classic
literatures--could teach a man who made scholarship his glory. He not
only possesses knowledge, but he knows whence he has acquired it; he
can cite his authorities by chapter and paragraph, and he sometimes
garnishes his plays with so many learned references that they bristle
with notes like an academic thesis.

Colossal, coarse-grained, vigorous, and always ready for the fray, with
his gigantic burden of learning, he has been compared by Taine to one
of those war-elephants of antiquity which bore on their backs a whole
fortress, with garrison, armoury, and munitions, and under the weight
of this panoply could yet move as quickly as a fleet-footed horse.

It must have been intensely interesting for their comrades at the
Mermaid to listen to the discussions between Jonson and Shakespeare,
to follow two such remarkable minds, so differently organised and
equipped, when they debated, in jest or earnest, this or that historic
problem, this or that moot point in �sthetics; and no less interesting
is it for us, in our days, to compare their almost contemporaneous
dramatic treatment of Roman antiquity. We might here expect Shakespeare
to have the worst of it, since he, according to Jonson's well-known
phrase, had "small Latine and less Greek;" while Ben was as much
at home in ancient Rome as in the London of his day, and, with his
altogether masculine talent, could claim a certain kinship with the
Roman spirit.

And yet even here Shakespeare stands high above Jonson, who, with all
his learning and industry, lacks his great contemporary's sense for the
fundamental element in human nature, to which the terms good and bad do
not apply, and has, besides, very few of those unforeseen inspirations
of genius which constitute Shakespeare's strength, and make up for all
the gaps in his knowledge. Jonson, moreover, could not modulate into
the minor key, and is thus unable to depict the inmost subtleties of
feminine character.

None the less would it be unjust to make Jonson, as the Germans are
apt to do, nothing but a foil to Shakespeare. We must, in mere equity,
bring out the points at which he attains to real greatness.

Although the scene of _The Poetaster_ is laid in Rome in the days of
Augustus, the play eludes comparison with Shakespeare's Roman dramas in
so far as its costume is partly a mere travesty under which Ben Jonson
defends himself against his contemporaries Marston and Dekker, who also
figure, of course, in a Roman disguise. Even here, however, he has done
his best to give an accurate picture of antique Roman manners, and
has applied to the task all his learning, with rather too little aid,
perhaps, from his fancy. His comic figures, for instance, the intrusive
Crispinus and the foolish singer Hermogenes, are taken bodily from
Horace's Satires (Book i. Satires 3 and 9); but both these pleasant
caricatures are executed with vigour and life.

Ben Jonson has in this play woven together three different actions, one
only of which has a symbolic meaning outside the frame of the picture.
In the first place, he presents Ovid's struggle for leave to follow his
poetic vocation, his suspected love-affair with Augustus's daughter,
Julia, and his banishment from the court when Augustus discovers the
intrigue between the young poet and his child. In the second place, he
introduces us into the house of the rich bourgeois Albius, who has been
ill-advised enough to marry one of the emancipated great ladies of the
period, Chloe by name, and who, by her help, obtains admission to court
society. Chloe's house is a meeting-place for all the love-poets of the
period, Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Cornelius Gallus, and the ladies
who favour them; and Jonson has succeeded very fairly in suggesting
the free tone of conversation prevalent in those circles, which
was doubtless reproduced in many circles of London life during the
Renaissance. Finally, we have a representation--Jonson's chief object
in writing the play--of the conspiracy of the bad and envious poets
against Horace, which culminates in a formal impeachment. The Emperor
himself, and the famous poets of his court, form a sort of tribunal
before which the case is tried. Horace is acquitted on every count,
and the accusers are sentenced to a punishment entirely in the spirit
of the Aristophanic comedy--so foreign to Shakespeare--Crispinus being
forced to take a pill of hellebore, which makes him vomit up all the
affected or merely novel words he has used, which appear to Ben Jonson
ridiculous. Some of them--for example the first two, "retrograde" and
"reciprocal"--have nevertheless survived in modern English. In spite of
its allegorical character, the episode is not deficient in an almost
too pungent realism.

The most Roman of all these scenes are doubtless those in which the
gallantry between the young men and the ladies, and the snobbery which
forces its way into Augustus's court, are freely represented. Less
Roman, by reason of their too palpable tendency, are the scenes in
which Augustus appears in the circle of his court poets. No serious
attempt is made to portray the Emperor's character, and the speeches
placed in the mouths of the poets are very clearly designed simply for
the glorification of poetry in general, and Ben Jonson in particular.

The sins of which his enemies were always accusing him were "self-love,
arrogancy, impudence, and railing," together with "filching by
translation." As he explains in the defensive dialogue which he
appended to his play, it was his purpose--

    "To show that Virgil, Horace, and the rest
     Of those great master-spirits, did not want
     Detractors then, or practisers against them."

He makes foolish persons find injurious allusions to themselves, and
even insults to the Emperor, in entirely innocent poems of Horace's,
and shows how the Emperor orders them to be whipped as backbiters.
Horace's literary relation to the Greeks, be it noted, was not unlike
that of Ben Jonson himself to the Latin writers.

A special interest attaches for us to the passage in the fifth act,
where, immediately before Virgil's entrance, the different poets, at
the suggestion of the Emperor, express their judgment of his genius,
and where Horace, after warmly protesting against the common belief
that one poet is necessarily envious of another, joins in the general
eulogy of his great rival. There is this remarkable circumstance about
the encomiums on Virgil, here placed in the mouths of Gallus, Tibullus,
and Horace, that while some of them are appropriate enough to the real
Virgil (else all verisimilitude would have been sacrificed), others
seem unmistakably to point away from Virgil towards one or other famous
contemporary of Jonson's own. Look for a moment at these speeches (v.
I):--

    "_Tibullus_.              That which he hath writ
        Is with such judgment labour'd, and distill'd
        Through all the needful uses of our lives,
        That could a man remember but his lines,
        He should not touch at any serious point,
        But he might breathe his spirit out of him.
    _Augustus_. You mean, he might repeat part of his works
        As fit for any conference he can use?
    _Tibullus_. True, royal C�sar.
    _Horace_. His learning savours not the school-like gloss
        That most consists in echoing words and terms,
        And soonest wins a man an empty name;
        Nor any long or far-fetch'd circumstance
        Wrapp'd in the curious generalties of arts,
        But a direct and analytic sum
        Of all the worth and first effects of arts.
        And for his poesy, 'tis so ramm'd with life,
        That it shall gather strength of life, with being,
        And live hereafter more admired than now."

Can we conceive that Ben Jonson had not Shakespeare in his eye as he
wrote these speeches, which apply better to him than to any one else?
It is true that a Shakespeare scholar of such authority as the late C.
M. Ingleby, the compiler of _Shakespeare's Centurie of Prayse_, has
declared against this theory, together with Nicholson and Furnivall.
But none of them has brought forward any conclusive argument to
prevent us from following Ben Jonson's admirer, Gifford, and his
impartial critic, John Addington Symonds, in accepting these speeches
as allusions to Shakespeare. It is useless to be for ever citing the
passage in _The Return from Parnassus_, as to the "purge" Shakespeare
has given Ben Jonson, in proof that there was an open feud between
them, when, in fact, there is no evidence whatever of any hostility
on Shakespeare's part; and the very stress laid on the assertion that
Horace, as a poet, is innocent of envy towards a famous and popular
colleague, makes it unreasonable to take the eulogies as applying
solely to the real Virgil, whom they fit so imperfectly. Of course
it by no means follows that we are to conceive every word of these
eulogies as unreservedly applied to Shakespeare; the speeches seem to
have been purposely left somewhat vague, so that they might at once
point to the ancient poet and suggest the modern. But out of the mists
of the characterisation certain definite contours stand forth; and the
physiognomy which they form, the picture of the great teacher in all
earthly affairs, rich, not in book-learning, but in the wisdom of life,
whose poetry is so vital that it will live through the ages with an
ever-intenser life--this portrait we know and recognise as that of the
genius with the great, calm eyes under the lofty brow.

Ben Jonson's _Sejanus_, which dates from 1603, only two years after
_The Poetaster_, is a historical tragedy of the time of Tiberius, in
which the poet, without any reference to contemporary personalities,
sets forth to depict the life and customs of the imperial court. It is
as an arch�ologist and moralist, however, that he depicts them, and his
method is thus very different from Shakespeare's. He not only displays
a close acquaintance with the life of the period, but penetrates
through the outward forms to its spirit. He is animated, indeed, by a
purely moral indignation against the turbulent and corrupt protagonist
of his tragedy, but his wrath does not prevent him from giving a
careful delineation of the figure of Sejanus in relation to its
surroundings, by means of thoughtfully-designed and even imaginative
individual scenes. Jonson does not, like Shakespeare, display from
within the character of this unscrupulous and audacious man, but he
shows the circumstances which have produced it, and its modes of action.

The difference between Jonson's and Shakespeare's method is not that
Jonson pedantically avoids the anachronisms which swarm in _Julius
C�sar_. In both plays, for instance, watches are spoken of.[1] But Ben,
on occasion, can paint a scene of Roman life with as much accuracy
as we find in a picture by Alma Tadema or a novel by Flaubert. For
example, when he depicts an act of worship and sacrifice in the
Sacellum or private chapel of Sejanus's house (v. 4), every detail of
the ceremonial is correct. After the Herald (Pr�co) has uttered the
formula, "Be all profane far hence," and horn and flute players have
performed their liturgical music, the priest (Flamen) exhorts all to
appear with "pure hands, pure vestments, and pure minds;" his acolytes
intone the complementary responses; and while the trumpets are again
sounded, he takes honey from the altar with his finger, tastes it, and
gives it to the others to taste; goes through the same process with
the milk in an earthen vessel; and then sprinkles milk over the altar,
"kindleth his gums," and goes with the censer round the altar, upon
which he ultimately places it, dropping "branches of poppy" upon the
smouldering incense. In justification of these traits, Jonson gives no
fewer than thirteen footnotes, in which passages are cited from a very
wide range of Latin authors. Kalisch has counted the notes appended to
this play, and finds 291 in all. The ceremonial is here employed to
introduce a scene in which "great Mother Fortune," to whom the libation
is made, averts her face from Sejanus, and thereby portends his fall;
whereupon, in an access of fury, he overturns her statue and altar.

Another scene, constructed with quite as much learning, and far more
able and remarkable, is that which opens the second Act. Livia's
physician, Eudemus, has been suborned by Sejanus to procure him a
meeting with the princess, and, moreover, to concoct a potent poison
for her husband. In the act of assisting his mistress to rouge her
cheek, and recommending her an effective "dentrifice" and a "prepared
pomatum to smooth the skin," he answers her casual questions as to who
is to present the poisoned cup to Drusus and induce him to drink it.
Here, again, Ben Jonson's mastery of detail displays itself. Eudemus's
remark, for example, that the "ceruse" on Livia's cheeks has faded in
the sun, is supported by a reference to an epigram of Martial, from
which it appears that this cosmetic was injured by heat. But here all
these details are merged in the potent general impression produced by
the dispassionate and business-like calmness with which the impending
murder is arranged in the intervals of a disquisition upon those
devices of the toilet which are to enchain the contriver of the crime.

Ben Jonson possesses the undaunted insight and the vigorous
pessimism which render it possible to represent Roman depravity and
wild-beast-like ferocity under the first Emperors without extenuation
and without declamation. He cannot, indeed, dispense with a sort of
chorus of honourable Romans, but they express themselves, as a rule,
pithily and without prolixity; and he has enough sense of art and of
history never to let his ruffians and courtesans repent.

Now and then he even attains to a Shakespearian level. The scene in
which Sejanus approaches Eudemus first with jesting talk, and then,
with wily insinuations, worms himself into his acquaintance and makes
him his creature, while Eudemus, with crafty servility, shows that
he can take a half-spoken hint, and, without for a moment committing
himself, offers his services as pander and assassin--this passage is in
no way inferior to the scene in Shakespeare's _King John_ in which the
King suggests to Hubert the murder of Arthur.

The most remarkable scene, however, is that (v. 10) in which the Senate
is assembled in the Temple of Apollo to hear messages from Tiberius
in his retreat at Capri. The first letter confers upon Sejanus "the
tribunitial dignity and power," with expressions of esteem, and the
Senate loudly acclaims the favourite. Then the second letter is read.
It is expressed in a strangely contorted style, begins with some
general remarks on public policy, hypocritical in tone, then turns,
like the first, to Sejanus, and, to the astonishment of all, dwells
with emphasis upon his low origin and the rare honours to which he has
been preferred. Already the hearers are alarmed; but the impression is
obliterated by new sentences of flattery. Then unfavourable opinions
and judgments regarding the favourite are cited and dwelt upon with
a certain complacency; then they are refuted with some vehemence;
finally, they are brought forward again, and this time in a manner
unmistakably hostile to Sejanus. Immediately the senators who have
swarmed around him withdraw from his neighbourhood, leaving him in the
centre of an empty space; and the reading continues until Laco enters
with the guards who are to arrest the hitherto all-powerful favourite
and lead him away. We can find no parallel to this reading of the
letter and the vacillations it produces among the cringing senators,
save in Antony's speech over the body of C�sar and the consequent
revulsion in the attitude and temper of the Roman mob. Shakespeare's
scene is more vividly projected, and shines with the poet's humour;
Jonson's scene is elaborated with grim energy, and worked out with the
moralist's bitterness. But in the dramatic movement of the moralist's
scene, no less than of the poet's, antique Rome lives again.

Jonson's _Catiline_, written some time later, appeared in 1611, and
was dedicated to Pembroke. Although executed on the same principles,
it is on the whole inferior to _Sejanus_; but it is better fitted for
comparison with _Julius C�sar_ in so far as its action belongs to the
same period, and C�sar himself appears in it. The second act of the
tragedy is in its way a masterpiece. As soon as Jonson enters upon
the political action proper, he transcribes endless speeches from
Cicero, and becomes intolerably tedious; but so long as he keeps to the
representation of manners, and seeks, as in his comedies, to paint a
quite unemotional picture of the period, he shows himself at his best.

This second act takes place at the house of Fulvia, the lady who,
according to Sallust, betrayed to Cicero the conspirators' secret. The
whole picture produces an entirely convincing effect. She first repels
with unfeeling coldness an intrusive friend and protector, Catiline's
fellow-conspirator, Curius; but when he at last turns away in anger,
telling her that she will repent her conduct when she finds herself
excluded from participation in an immense booty which will fall to the
share of others, she calls him back, full of curiosity and interest,
becomes suddenly friendly, and even caressing, and wrings from him
his secret, instantly recognising, however, that Cicero will pay for
it without stint, and that this money is considerably safer than the
sum which might fall to her share in a general revolution. Her visit
to Cicero, with his craftily friendly interrogatory, first of her,
and then of her lover Curius, whom he summons and converts into one
of his spies, deserves the highest praise. These scenes contain the
concentrated essence of Sallust's _Catiline_ and of Cicero's Orations
and Letters. The Cicero of this play rises high above the Cicero to
whom Shakespeare has assigned a few speeches. C�sar, on the other
hand, comes off no better at Ben Jonson's hands than at Shakespeare's.
The poet was obviously determined to show a certain independence of
judgment in the way in which he has treated Sallust's representation
both of C�sar and of Cicero. Sallust, whom Jonson nevertheless follows
in the main, is hostile to Cicero and defends C�sar. The worthy Ben, on
the other hand, was, as a man of letters, a sworn admirer of Cicero,
while in C�sar he sees only a cold, crafty personage, who sought to
make use of Catiline for his own ends, and therefore joined forces with
him, but repudiated him when things went wrong, and was so influential
that Cicero dared not attack him when he rooted out the conspiracy.
Thus the great Caius Julius did not touch Jonson's manly heart any more
than Shakespeare's. He appears throughout in an extremely unsympathetic
light, and no speech, no word of his, portends his coming greatness.

Of this greatness Jonson had probably no deep realisation. It
is surprising enough to note that the scholars and poets of the
Renaissance, in so far as they took sides in the old strife between
C�sar and Pompey, were all on Pompey's side. Even in the seventeenth
century, in France, under a despotism more absolute than C�sar's, the
men who were familiar with antique history, and who, for the rest, vied
with each other in loyalty and king-worship, were unanimously opposed
to C�sar. Strange as it may seem, it is not until our century, with
its hostility to despotism and its continuous advance in the direction
of democracy, that C�sar's genius has been fully appreciated, and the
benefits his life conferred on humanity have been thoroughly understood.

The personal relation between Ben Jonson and Shakespeare is not to this
day quite clearly ascertained. It was for long regarded as distinctly
hostile, no one doubting that Jonson, during his great rival's
lifetime, cherished an obstinate jealousy towards him. More recently,
Jonson's admirers have argued with warmth that cruel injustice has been
done him in this respect. So far as we can now judge, it appears that
Jonson honestly recognised and admired Shakespeare's great qualities,
but at the same time felt a displeasure he never could quite conquer
at seeing him so much more popular as a dramatist, and--as was only
natural--regarded his own tendencies in art as truer and better
justified.

In the preface to _Sejanus_ (edition of 1605) Jonson uses an expression
which, as the piece was acted by Shakespeare's company, and Shakespeare
himself appeared in it, was long interpreted as referring to him.
Jonson writes:--

    "Lastly, I would inform you that this book, in all numbers,
    is not the same with that which was acted on the public
    stage, wherein a second pen had good share; in place of
    which, I have rather chosen to put weaker, and, no doubt,
    less pleasing, of mine own, than to defraud so happy a
    genius of his right by my loathed usurpation."

The words "so happy a genius," in particular, together with the
other circumstances, have directed the thoughts of commentators to
Shakespeare. Mr. Brinsley Nicholson, however (in the _Academy_, Nov.
14th, 1874), has shown it to be far more probable that the person
alluded to is not Shakespeare, but a very inferior poet, Samuel
Sheppard. The marked politeness of Jonson's expressions may be due to
his having inflicted on his collaborator a considerable disappointment,
almost an insult, by omitting his portion of the work, and at the same
time excluding his name from the title-page. It seems, at any rate,
that Samuel Sheppard felt wounded by this proceeding, since, more
than forty years later, he claimed for himself the honour of having
collaborated in _Sejanus_, in a verse which is ostensibly a panegyric
on Jonson.[2] Symonds, so late as 1888, nevertheless maintains in his
_Ben Jonson_ that the preface most probably refers to Shakespeare; but
he does not refute or even mention Nicholson's carefully-marshalled
argument.

It is not, however, of great importance to decide whether a compliment
in one of Jonson's prefaces is or is not addressed to Shakespeare,
since we have ample evidence in the warm eulogy and mild criticism
in his _Discoveries_, and in the enthusiastic poem prefixed to the
First Folio, that the crusty Ben (who, moreover, is said to have been
Shakespeare's boon companion on his last convivial evening) regarded
him with the warmest feelings, at least towards the close of his life
and after his death.

This does not exclude the probability that Jonson's radically different
literary ideals may have led him to make incidental and sometimes
rather tart allusions to what appeared to him weak or mistaken in
Shakespeare's work.

There is no foundation for the theory which has sometimes been
advanced, that the passage in _The Poetaster_ ridiculing Crispinus's
coat of arms is an allusion to Shakespeare. It is beyond all doubt
that the figure of Crispinus was exclusively intended for Marston; he
himself, at any rate, did not for a moment doubt it. For the rest,
Jonson's ascertained or conjectured side-glances at Shakespeare are
these:--

In the prologue to _Every Man in his Humour_, which can scarcely have
been spoken when the play was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's
company, not only is realistic art proclaimed the true art, in
opposition to the romanticism which prevailed on the Shakespearian
stage, but a quite definite attack is made on those who

                  "With three rusty swords,
    And help of some few foot and half-foot words,
    Fight over York and Lancaster's long jars."

And this is followed by a really biting criticism of the works of other
playwrights, concluding--

                    "There's hope left then,
    You, that have so graced monsters, may like men."

The possible jibe at _Twelfth Night_ in _Every Man out of his Humour_
(iii. I) has already been mentioned (_ante_, p. 272). That, too, must
be of late insertion, and is at worst extremely innocent.

Much has been made of the passage in _Volpone_ (iii. 2) where Lady
Politick Would-be, speaking of Guarini's _Pastor Fido_, says:--

                    "All our English writers
    Will deign to steal out of this author, mainly:
    Almost as much as from Montagni�."

This has been interpreted as an accusation of plagiarism, some pointing
it at the well-known passage in _The Tempest_, where Shakespeare has
annexed some lines, from Montaigne's Essays; others at _Hamlet_, which
has throughout many points of contact with the French philosopher. But
_The Tempest_ was undoubtedly written long after _Volpone_, and the
relation of _Hamlet_ to Montaigne is such as to render it scarcely
conceivable that an accusation of plagiarism could be founded upon it.
Here again Jonson seems to have been groundlessly suspected of malice.

Jacob Feis (_Shakespeare and Montaigne_, p. 183) would fain see in
Nano's song about the hermaphrodite Androgyno a shameless attack upon
Shakespeare, simply because the names Pythagoras and Euphorbus appear
in it (_Volpone_, i. I), as they do in the well-known passage in Meres;
but this accusation is entirely fantastic. Equally unreasonable is it
of Feis to discover an obscene besmirching of the figure of Ophelia in
that passage of Jonson, Marston, and Chapman's _Eastward Ho!_ (iii. 2)
where there occur some passing allusions to _Hamlet_.

There remain, then, in reality, only one or two passages in
_Bartholomew Fair_, dating from 1614. We have already seen (_ante_, p.
337) that there may possibly be a satirical allusion to the Sonnets
in the introduced puppet-play, _The Touchstone of True Love_. The
Induction contains an unquestionable jibe, both at _The Tempest_ and
_The Winter's Tale_, whose airy poetry the downright Ben was unable to
appreciate.[3] Neither Caliban nor the element of enchantment in _The
Tempest_ appealed to him, and in _The Winters Tale_, as in _Pericles_,
it offended his classic taste and his Aristotelian theories that the
action should extend over a score of years, so that we see infants in
one act reappear in the next as grown-up young women.

But these trifling intolerances and impertinences must not tempt us to
forget that it was Ben Jonson who wrote of Shakespeare those great and
passionate lines:--

     "Triumph, my Britain! thou hast one to show
    To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
    He was not of an age, but for all time!"


[1] "Observe him as his watch observes his clock."--_Sejanus_, i. I.

[2] He says of Jonson in _The Times Displayed in Six Sesfyads_:--

    "So His, that Divine Plautus equalled,
     Whose Commick vain Menander nere could hit,
     Whose tragic sceans shal be with wonder Read
     By after ages, for unto his wit
     My selfe gave personal ayd, _I_ dictated
     To him when as _Sejanus_ fall he writ,
     And yet on earth some foolish sots there bee
     That dare make Randolph his Rival in degree."

[3] "If there be never a servant-monster in the fair, who can help
it, he says, nor a nest of antiques? He is loth to make Nature afraid
in his plays, like those that beget tales, tempests, and such-like
drolleries."




XI

_HAMLET: ITS ANTECEDENTS IN FICTION, HISTORY, AND DRAMA_

Many and various emotions crowded upon Shakespeare's mind in the year
1601. In its early months Essex and Southampton were condemned. At
exactly the same time there occurs the crisis in the relations of
Pembroke and Shakespeare with the Dark Lady. Finally, in the early
autumn, Shakespeare suffered a loss which he must have felt deeply. The
Stratford register of burials for 1601 contains this line--

    _Septemb._ 8. Mr. _Johannes Shakespeare_.

He lost his father, his earliest friend and guardian, whose honour and
reputation lay so near to his heart. The father probably lived with his
son's family in the handsome New Place, which Shakespeare had bought
four years before. He had doubtless brought up the two girls Susannah
and Judith; he had doubtless sat by the death-bed of the little Hamnet.
Now he was no more. All the years of his youth, spent at his father's
side, revived in Shakespeare's mind, memories flocked in upon him, the
fundamental relation between son and father preoccupied his thoughts,
and he fell to brooding over filial love and filial reverence.

In the same year _Hamlet_ began to take shape in Shakespeare's
imagination.

_Hamlet_ has given the name of Denmark a world-wide renown. Of all
Danish men, there is only one who can be called famous on the largest
scale; only one with whom the thoughts of men are for ever busied in
Europe, America, Australia, aye, even in Asia and Africa, wherever
European culture has made its way; and this one never existed, at any
rate in the form in which he has become known to the world. Denmark
has produced several men of note--Tycho Brahe, Thorvaldsen, and Hans
Christian Andersen--but none of them has attained a hundredth part of
Hamlet's fame. The _Hamlet_ literature is comparable in extent to the
literature of one of the smaller European peoples--the Slovaks, for
instance.

As it is interesting to follow with the eye the process by which a
block of marble slowly assumes human form, so it is interesting to
observe how the _Hamlet_ theme gradually acquires its Shakespearian
character.

The legend first appears in Saxo Grammaticus. Fengo murders his
brave brother Horvendil, and marries his widow Gerutha (Gertrude).
Horvendil's son, Amleth, determines to disarm Fengo's malevolence
by feigning madness. In order to test whether he is really mad, a
beautiful girl is thrown in his way, who is to note whether, in his
passion for her, he still maintains the appearance of madness. But a
foster-brother and friend of Amleth's reveals the plot to him; the
girl, too, has an old affection for him; and nothing is discovered.
Here lie the germs of Ophelia and Horatio.

With regard to Amleth's mad talk, it is explained that, having a
conscientious objection to lying, he so contorted his sayings that,
though he always said what he meant, people could not discover
whether he meant what he said, or himself understood it--an account
of the matter which applies quite as well to the dark sayings of the
Shakespearian Hamlet as to the na�ve riddling of the Jutish Amleth.

Polonius, too, is here already indicated--especially the scene in which
he plays eavesdropper to Hamlet's conversation with his mother. One of
the King's friends (_pr�sumtione quam solertia abundantior_) proposes
that some one shall conceal himself in the Queen's chamber. Amleth runs
his sword through him and throws the dismembered body to the pigs, as
Hamlet in the play drags the body out with him. Then ensues Amleth's
speech of reproach to his mother, of which not a little is retained
even in Shakespeare:--

    "Think'st thou, woman, that these hypocritical tears can
    cleanse thee of shame, thee, who like a wanton hast cast
    thyself into the arms of the vilest of nithings, hast
    incestuously embraced thy husband's murderer, and basely
    flatterest and fawnest upon the man who has made thy son
    fatherless! What manner of creature doest thou resemble? Not
    a woman, but a dumb beast who couples at random."

Fengo resolves to send Amleth to meet his death in England, and
despatches him thither with two attendants, to whom Shakespeare, as
we know, has given the names of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern--the
names of two Danish noblemen whose signatures have been found in close
juxtaposition (with the date 1577) in an album which probably belonged
to a Duke of W�rtemberg. They were colleagues in the Council of Regency
during the minority of Christian IV. These attendants (according to
Saxo) had rune-staves with them, on which Amleth altered the runes, as
in the play he re-writes the letters.

One more little touch is, as it were, led up to in Saxo: the exchange
of the swords. Amleth, on his return, finds the King's men assembled
at his own funeral feast. He goes around with a drawn sword, and on
trying its edge against his nails he once or twice cuts himself with
it. Therefore they nail his sword fast into its sheath. When Amleth has
set fire to the hall and rushes into Fengo's chamber to murder him,
he takes the King's sword from its hook and replaces it with his own,
which the King in vain attempts to draw before he dies.

Now that Hamlet, more than any other Dane, has made the name of his
fatherland world-famous, it impresses us strangely to read this
utterance of Saxo's: "Imperishable shall be the memory of the steadfast
youth who armed himself against falsehood with folly, and with it
marvellously cloaked the splendour of heaven-radiant wisdom.... He
left history in doubt as to whether his heroism or his wisdom was the
greater."

The Hamlet of the tragedy, with reference to his mother's too hasty
marriage, says, "Frailty, thy name is woman!" Saxo remarked with
reference to Amleth's widow, who was in too great a hurry to marry
again: "Thus it is with all the promises of women: they are scattered
like chaff before the wind and pass away like waves of the sea. Who
then will trust to a woman's heart, which changes as flowers shed their
leaves, as seasons change, and as new events wipe out the traces of
those that went before?"

In Saxo's eyes, Amleth represented not only wisdom, but bodily
strength. While the Hamlet of Shakespeare expressly emphasises the
fact that he is anything but Herculean ("My father's brother, but no
more like my father than I to Hercules"), Saxo expressly compares his
hero to the Club-Bearer whose name is a synonym for strength: "And the
fame of men shall tell of him that, if it had been given him to live
his life fortunately to the end, his excellent dispositions would have
displayed themselves in deeds greater than those of Hercules, and would
have adorned his brows with the demigod's wreath." It sounds almost as
though Shakespeare's Hamlet entered a protest against these words of
Saxo.

In the year 1559 the legend was reproduced in French in Belleforest's
_Histoires Tragiques_, and seems in this form to have reached England,
where it furnished material for the older _Hamlet_ drama, now lost,
but to which we find frequent allusions. It cannot be proved that this
play was founded upon Pavier's English translation of Belleforest, or
even that Shakespeare had Pavier before him; for the oldest edition
of the translation which has come down to us (reprinted in Collier's
_Shakespeare's Library_, ed. 1875, pt. I. vol. ii. p. 224) dates
from 1608, and contains certain details (such as the eavesdropper's
concealment behind the arras, and Hamlet's exclamation of "A rat!
a rat!" before he kills Polonius) of which there is no trace in
Belleforest, and which may quite as well have been taken from Shakespeare's
tragedy, as borrowed by him from an unknown older edition of the novel.

The earliest known allusion to the old _Hamlet_ drama is the phrase of
Thomas Nash, dating from 1589, quoted above (p. 91). In 1594
the Lord Chamberlain's men (Shakespeare's company), acting together
with the Lord Admiral's men at the Newington Butts theatre under the
management of Henslow and others, performed a _Hamlet_ with reference
to which Henslow notes in his account-book for June 9th: "Rd. at hamlet
... viii s." This play must have been the old one, for Henslow would
otherwise have added the letters _ne_ (new), and the receipts would
have been much greater. His share, as we see, was only eight shillings,
whereas it was sometimes as much as nine pounds.

The chief interest of this older play seems to have centred in a figure
added by the dramatist--the Ghost of the murdered King, which cried
"Hamlet, revenge!" This cry is frequently quoted. It first appears
in 1596 in Thomas Lodge's _Wits Miserie_, where it is said of the
author that he "looks as pale as the visard of ye ghost, which cried
so miserably at ye theator like an oister-wife, _Hamlet, revenge_" It
next occurs in Dekker's _Satiromastix_, 1602, where Tucca says, "My
name's _Hamlet, revenge!_" In 1605 we find it in Thomas Smith's _Voiage
and Entertainement in Rushia_; and it is last found in 1620 in Samuel
Rowland's _Night Raven_, where, however, it seems to be an inaccurate
quotation from the _Hamlet_ we know.

Shakespeare's play was entered in the Stationers' Register on the
26th of July 1602, under the title "A booke called _'the Revenge of
Hamlett Prince_ [of] _Denmarke' as yt was latelie Acted by the Lord
Chamberleyne his servantes._"

That it made an instant success on the stage is almost proved by the
fact that so early as the 7th of July the opposition manager Henslow
pays Chettle twenty shillings for "The Danish Tragedy," evidently a
furbishing up of the old play.

The publication of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, however, did not take
place till 1603. Then appeared the First Quarto, indubitably a
pirated edition, either founded entirely on shorthand notes, or on
shorthand notes eked out by aid of the actors' parts, and completed,
in certain passages, from memory. Although this edition certainly
contains a debased and corrupt text, it is impossible to attribute to
the misunderstandings or oversights of a copyist or stenographer all
its divergences from the carefully-printed quarto of the following
year, which is practically identical with the First Folio text. The
differences are so great as to exclude such a theory. We have evidently
before us Shakespeare's first sketch of the play, although in a very
defective form; and, as far as we can see, this first sketch keeps
considerably closer than the definitive text to the old _Hamlet_ drama,
on which Shakespeare based his play. Here and there, though with
considerable uncertainty, we can even trace scenes from the old play
among Shakespeare's, and touches of its style mingling with his. It is
very significant, also, that there are more rhymes in the First than in
the Second Quarto.

The most remarkable feature in the 1603 edition is a scene between
Horatio and the Queen in which he tells her of the King's frustrated
scheme for having Hamlet murdered in England. The object of this
scene is to absolve the Queen from complicity in the King's crime;
a purpose which can also be traced in other passages of this first
edition, and which seems to be a survival from the older drama. So
far as we can gather, Horatio appears to have played an altogether
more prominent part in the old play; Hamlet's madness appears to have
been wilder; and Polonius probably bore the name of Corambis, which
is prefixed to his speeches in the edition of 1603. Finally, as we
have seen, Shakespeare took the important character of the Ghost, not
indicated in either the legend or the novel, from this earlier _Hamlet_
tragedy. The theory that it is the original of the German tragedy, _Der
bestrafte Brudermord,_ published by Cohn, from a manuscript of 1710, is
unsupported by evidence.

Looking backward through the dramatic literature of England, we find
that the author of the old _Hamlet_ drama in all probability sought
inspiration in his turn in Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_. It appears from
allusions in Jonson's _Cynthia's Revels_ and _Bartholomew Fair_ that
this play must have been written about 1584. It was one of the most
popular plays of its day with the theatre-going public. So late as
1632, Prynne in his _Histriomastix_ speaks of a woman who, on her
death-bed, instead of seeking the consolations of religion, cried out:
"Hieronimo, Hieronimo! O let me see Hieronimo acted!"

The tragedy opens, after the fashion of its models in Seneca, with the
apparition of the murdered man's ghost, and his demand for vengeance.
Thus the Ghost in Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ is lineally descended from
the spirit of Tantalus in Seneca's _Thyestes_, and from the spirit of
Thyestes in Seneca's _Agamemnon_. Hieronimo, who has been driven mad by
sorrow for the loss of his son, speaking to the villain of the piece,
gives half-ironical, half-crazy expression to the anguish that is
torturing him:--

    "_Lorenzo_. Why so, Hieronimo? use me.
     _Hieronimo_. Who? you my lord?
          I reserve your favour for a greater honour:
          This is a very toy, my lord, a toy.
     _Lor_. All's one, Hieronimo, acquaint me with it.
     _Hier_. I' faith, my lord, 'tis an idle thing ...
          The murder of a son, or so--
          A thing of nothing, my lord!"

These phrases foreshadow Hamlet's speeches to the King. But Hieronimo
is really mad, although he speaks of his madness much as Hamlet does,
or rather denies it point-blank--

    "Villain, thou liest, and thou dost naught
     But tell me I am mad: thou liest, I am not mad.
     I know thee to be Pedro, and he Jaques;
     I'll prove it to thee; and were I mad, how could I?"

Here and there, especially in Ben Jonson's additions, we come across
speeches which lie very close to passages in Hamlet. A painter, who
also has lost his son, says to Hieronimo: "Ay, sir, no man did hold a
son so dear;" whereupon he answers--

    "What, not as thine? That is a lie,
     As massy as the earth: I had a son,
     Whose least unvalued hair did weigh
     A thousand of thy sons; and he was murdered."

Thus Hamlet cries to Laertes:--

    "I lov'd Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
     Could not, with all their quantity of love,
     Make up my sum."

Hieronimo, like Hamlet, again and again postpones his vengeance:--

             "All times fit not for revenge.
     Thus, therefore, will I rest me in unrest,
     Dissembling quiet in unquietness:
     Not seeming that I know their villainies,
     That my simplicity may make them think
     That ignorantly I will let all slip."

At last he determines to have a play acted, as a means to his revenge.
The play is Kyd's own _Solyman and Perseda_, and in the course of it
the guilty personages, who play the chief parts, are slaughtered, not
in make-believe, but in reality.

Crude and na�ve though everything still is in _The Spanish Tragedy_,
which resembles _Titus Andronicus_ in style rather than any other
of Shakespeare's works, it evidently, through the medium of the
earlier _Hamlet_ play, contributed a good deal to the foundations of
Shakespeare's _Hamlet_.

Before going more deeply into the contents of this great work, and
especially before trying to bring it into relation to Shakespeare's
personality, we have yet to see what suggestions or impulses the poet
may have found in contemporary history.

We have already remarked upon the impression which the Essex family
tragedy must have made upon Shakespeare in his early youth, before he
had even left Stratford. All England was talking of the scandal: how
the Earl of Leicester, who was commonly suspected of having had Lord
Essex poisoned, immediately after his death had married his widow,
Lady Lettice, whose lover no one doubted that he had been during her
husband's lifetime. There is much in the character of King Claudius to
suggest that Shakespeare has here taken Leicester as his model. The
two have in common ambition, sensuality, an ingratiating conciliatory
manner, astute dissimulation, and complete unscrupulousness. On
the other hand, it is quite unreasonable to suppose, with Hermann
Conrad,[1] that Shakespeare had Essex in his eye in drawing Hamlet
himself.

Almost as near to Shakespeare's own day as the Essex-Leicester
catastrophe had been the similar events in the Royal Family of
Scotland. Mary Stuart's second husband, Lord Darnley, who bore the
title of King of Scotland, had been murdered in 1567 by her lover, the
daring and unscrupulous Bothwell, whom the Queen almost immediately
afterwards married. Her contemporaries had no doubt whatever of
Mary's complicity in the assassination, and her son James saw in his
mother and his stepfather his father's murderers. The leaders of the
Scottish rebellion displayed before the captive Queen a banner bearing
a representation of Darnley's corpse, with her son kneeling beside it
and calling to Heaven for vengeance. Darnley, like the murdered King in
_Hamlet_, was an unusually handsome, Bothwell an unusually repulsive
man.

James was brought up by his mother's enemies, and during her lifetime,
and after her death, was perpetually wavering between her adherents,
who had defended her legal rights, and her adversaries, who had driven
her from the country and placed James himself upon the throne. He made
one or two efforts, indeed, to soften Elizabeth's feelings towards
his mother, but refrained from all attempt to avenge her death. His
character was irresolute. He was learned and--what Hamlet is very far
from being--a superstitious pedant; but, like Hamlet, he was a lover
of the arts and sciences, and was especially interested in the art of
acting. Between 1599 and 1601 he entertained in Scotland a portion of
the company to which Shakespeare belonged; but it is uncertain whether
Shakespeare himself ever visited Scotland. There is little doubt, on
the other hand, that when, after Elizabeth's death in 1603, James made
his entrance into London, Shakespeare, richly habited in a uniform of
red cloth, walked in his train along with Burbage and a few others
of the leading players. Their company was henceforth known as "His
Majesty's Servants."

Although there is in all this no lack of parallels to Hamlet's
circumstances, it is, of course, as ridiculous to take James as to take
Essex for the actual model of Hamlet. Nothing could at that time have
been stupider or more tactless than to remind the heir-presumptive
to the throne, or the new King, of the deplorable circumstances of
his early history. This does not exclude the supposition, however,
that contemporary history supplied Shakespeare with certain outward
elements, which, in the moment of conception, contributed to the
picture bodied forth by the creative energy of his genius.

From this point of view, too, we must regard the piles of material
which well-meaning students bring to light, in the artless belief that
they have discovered the very stones of which Shakespeare constructed
his dramatic edifice. People do not distinguish between the possibility
that the poet may have unconsciously received a suggestion here and
there for details of his work, and the theory that he deliberately
intended an imaginative reproduction of definite historic events.
No work of imagination assuredly, and least of all such a work as
_Hamlet_, comes into existence in the way these theorists assume. It
springs from within, has its origin in an overmastering sensation
in the poet's soul, and then, in the process of growth, assimilates
certain impressions from without.

XII

_"HAMLET"--MONTAIGNE AND GIORDANO BRUNO--ANTECEDENTS IN ETHNOGRAPHY_

Along with motives from novel, drama, and history, impressions of
a philosophical and quasi-scientific order went to the making of
_Hamlet_: Of all Shakespeare's plays, this is the profoundest and most
contemplative; a philosophic atmosphere breathes around it. Naturally
enough, then, criticism has set about inquiring to what influences we
may ascribe these broodings over life and death and the mysteries of
existence.

Several students, such as Tschischwitz and K�nig, have tried to make
out that Giordano Bruno exercised a preponderating influence upon
Shakespeare.[1] Passages suggesting a cycle in nature, such as Hamlet's
satirical outburst to the King about the dead Polonius (iv. 3), have
directed their thoughts to the Italian philosopher. In some cases they
have found or imagined a definite identity between sayings of Hamlet's
and of Bruno's--for instance, on determinism. Bruno has a passage in
which he emphasises the necessity by which everything is brought about:
"Whatever may be my pre-ordained eventide, when the change shall take
place, I await the day, I, who dwell in the night; but they await the
night who dwell in the daylight. All that is, is either here or there,
near or far off, now or after, soon or late." In the same spirit Hamlet
says (v. 2): "There is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.
If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now;
if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all." Bruno says:
"Nothing is absolutely imperfect or evil; it only seems so in relation
to something else, and what is bad for one is good for another." In
_Hamlet_ (ii. 2), "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking
makes it so."

When once attention had been directed to Giordano Bruno, not only
his philosophical and more popular writings, but even his plays were
ransacked in search of passages that might have influenced Shakespeare.
Certain parallels and points of resemblance were indeed discovered,
very slight and trivial in themselves, but which theorists would not
believe to be fortuitous, since it was known that Giordano Bruno had
passed some time in England in Shakespeare's day, and had frequented
the society of the most distinguished men. As soon as the matter was
closely investigated, however, the probability of any direct influence
vanished almost to nothing.

Giordano Bruno remained on English ground from 1583 to 1585. Coming
from France, where he had instructed Henri III. in the Lullian art,
a mechanical, mnemotechnic method for the solution of all possible
scientific problems, he brought with him a letter of recommendation to
Mauvissi�re, the French Ambassador, in whose house he was received as
a friend of the family during the whole of his stay in London. He made
the acquaintance of many leading men of the time, such as Walsingham,
Leicester, Burghley, Sir Philip Sidney and his literary circle, but
soon went on to Oxford in order to lecture there and disseminate the
doctrines which lay nearest his heart. These were the Copernican
system in opposition to the Ptolemaic, which still held the field at
Oxford, and the theory that the same principle of life is diffused
through everything--atoms and organisms, plants, animals, human beings,
and the universe at large. He quarrelled with the Oxford scholars,
and held them up to ridicule and contempt in his dialogue _La Cena
de le Ceneri_, published soon after, in which he speaks in the most
disparaging terms of the coarseness of English manners. The dirtiness
of the London streets, for example, and the habit of letting one goblet
go round the table, from which every one drank, aroused his dislike and
scorn scarcely less than the rejection of Copernicus by the pedants of
the University.

At the very earliest, Shakespeare cannot have come to London until the
year of Bruno's departure from England, and can therefore scarcely have
met him. The philosopher exercised no influence upon the spiritual
life of the day in England. Not even Sir Philip Sidney was attracted
by his doctrine, and his name does not once occur in Greville's Life
of Sidney, although Greville had seen much of Bruno. Brunnhofer, who
has studied the question, points out, as showing how little trace Bruno
left behind him in England, that there is not in the Bodleian a single
contemporary manuscript or document of any kind which throws the least
light upon Bruno's stay in London or Oxford.[2] It has been maintained,
nevertheless, that Shakespeare must have read his philosophic writings
in Italian. It is, of course, possible; but there is nothing in
_Hamlet_ to prove it--nothing that cannot be fully accounted for
without assuming that he had the slightest acquaintance with them.

The only expression in Shakespeare which, probably by accident, has an
entirely pantheistic ring is "The prophetic soul of the wide world"
in Sonnet cvii.; the only passages containing an idea, not certainly
identical, but comparable with Bruno's doctrine of the metamorphosis of
natural forms are the cyclical Sonnets lix., cvi., cxxiii. If Giordano
Bruno really had anything to do with these passages, it must be because
Shakespeare had heard some talk about the great Italian's doctrine,
which may just at that time have been recalled to the recollection
of his English acquaintances by his death at the stake in Rome, on
February 17, 1600. If Shakespeare had studied his writings, he would,
among other things, have obtained some glimmering of the Copernican
system, of which he knows nothing. On the other hand, it is quite
conceivable that he may have picked up in conversation an approximate
and incomplete conception of Bruno's philosophy, and that this
conception may have given birth to the above-mentioned philosophical
reveries. All the passages in _Hamlet_ which have been attributed to
the influence of Bruno really stand in much closer relation to writers
under whose literary and philosophical influence we know beyond a doubt
that Shakespeare fell.
